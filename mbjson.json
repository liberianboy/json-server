(Video)","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Virtual and augmented reality have come crashing into the real estate industry in the last couple of years, becoming a disruptive force in residential sales and leaving many people asking, what next? We've taken a look at some novel and interesting ways in which virtual reality will be used in urban planning in the future, looking not just at the obvious visualisation of individual developments, but behind the scenes at the substantive impact of such a technology on growing sustainable, smart cities in the future.Commonly known for its success in the gaming world, virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used to re-invigorate various industries such as aerospace, healthcare, education and now, urban planning. As populations continue to rise, placing an increased strain on our public services, cities become smarter and more complicated. VR serves as a knight in shining armour for urban planners to help visualise prospective projects and their impacts on infrastructure and the environment.More importantly, there is a huge amount of money going into the industry to develop and innovate. According to technology advisors Digi-Capital[1], it is expected to be a $30 billion segment of a larger $150 billion augmented reality/virtual reality market by 2020. With PropTech predicated to be a key growth sector in the next few years, the collaboration between these markets is inevitable.But how much of an impact can VR actually make? Will we see rooms of planning lawyers, consultants and inspectors donning headsets in the near future? Visualisation techniques have long been used to inform the design process and improve the level of communication between end-users (i.e. the public), and decision makers (i.e. policy makers and planning authorities).Visualisation of Big DataWhen designing smart, sustainable cities the sheer amount of data that must be collected and processed can be overwhelming. The European Smart City Model (developed by the Vienna University of Technology) sets out six key pillars of a smart city:Suddenly urban planners are faced with a far greater number of factors that must be integrated into any city design masterplan going forward. There are huge numbers of professionals involved in large-scale city design, from clients, politicians, policy makers and planners to communities and individuals, all of whom need to understand this 'big data'.Currently, this big data is designed in 2D, and so the discussion around it proceeds in 2D. Paper maps, colour coding, and lengthy descriptions all play their part, along with industry jargon which inevitably confuses the lay person. It can be completely inaccessible. Sometimes 3D modelling might play its part, but this is very much a secondary function alongside top-down designs. There is a lot of 'imagination' required by non-technical stakeholders to really understand what is being proposed and there is arguably a query over whether the planners themselves sometimes understand what is being proposed.City masterplans are essentially visual in nature, so VR can be used to effectively overcome this barrier, giving a better understanding of how the smaller picture fits into the larger, and producing more involved feedback and designs. It forms a communication bridge between the technical and the reality, and will inevitably play a greater role as the technology improves.What-if scenariosWhen modelling any development, an impact analysis of 'what-if scenarios' can be a significant drain on resources. This is one of the main reasons that planning professionals are seeking new and novel methods for real-time data simulations. Step one is to be able to visualise the big data, but step two is to be able to manipulate it, to stress test it.Sustainability in city design requires different variables to be constantly tested: economic, social, environmental and physical subsystems of the urban landscape. Design and construction being inherently visceral, there is no better way to experience the tangible result of e.g. an electricity failure on the safety of pedestrians nearby than by being immersed in that scenario. The experiential nature of the technology becomes an invaluable tool when trying to mitigate the actual fallout of design or development flaws.Participatory planningParticipatory planning emphasises involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban and rural planning, overcoming conflict and harmonising views across many different groups of stakeholders. VR creates environments that can be directly entered into and interacted with, improving the quality of the feedback across these groups, and allowing the visualisation, communication and evaluation of new developments.Immediately tangible benefits include the ability to highlight what materials will be used in a development, what building(s) may look like inside and out, how they may impact on nearby land and even niche details such as where shadows will form or crowding may occur.The key thing is that participatory planning focuses on the collective, with decision making and policy making occurring via the active interaction between all stakeholders on an ongoing basis, not just during a one off 'consultation' exercise which is commonly the case now. It is less targeted at 'problem solving' and looks more at mutual learning, empowerment and ongoing partnerships/engagement - a sharing of the responsibility for designing and building a new urban environment under which everyone will benefit.Empathetic planningClosely linked to participatory planning, VR constructs can also have a more personal role in planning new cities and developments. A project at University College London named 'Palimpsest[2]' seeks to explore the way in which communities can be affected by new developments and to provide an empathetic way to experience such an impact. \"Using 3D scanning and virtual reality, our project records personal stories and local histories, layering them over the city at a 1:1 scale. Building this collective memory is especially important in areas undergoing dramatic urban redevelopment. Our first initiative, The Camden Palimpsest, uses the UK High Speed Rail 2 project as a case study. It highlights stories of Camden residents - some of whom will lose their homes and workplaces - and explores how their lives will be transformed. Our virtual Palimpsests aim to create more inclusive planning practices, using emerging technology to directly connect communities, governments, and developers in conversation.\" This case study of HS2 goes on to conceptually re-design the feedback model that traditional urban planning relies on.Although in its early stages and essentially just a research project, this is a fascinating example of how virtual reality will be used in the future. We may well see a time when VR technology is not only used by developers to display their shiny new buildings, but by protesters to really show others the negative impact that communities may suffer.Interactive Architecture Lab has created a video that imagines what an urban palimpsest can be in the digital age.Video - what an urban palimpsest can be in the digital age[3]A transcript of this video is available here[4].Inevitably as cities become more complicated, the entire community will have to be more involved in the strategic and management processes of urban and rural planning, overcoming conflict and harmonising views across many different groups of stakeholders. Virtual reality creates environments that can be directly entered into and interacted with, improving the quality of the feedback across these groups, and allowing the visualisation, communication and evaluation of new developments.Like what you read?

Hurricanes Recruiting: Official Visit preview, 1/25","content":"More key visits on deck for the Canes, both in Coral Gables and elsewhere in the CFB world Hello again, recruiting fan friends! It�s Friday, which means we have another Miami Hurricanes Official Visit Weekend on deck!\nThis is the penultimate Official Visit weekend of the contact period, and there is only 1 (!!!!!!) weekend after this until National Signing Day on February 6th. The time to make moves is now, and Manny Diaz�s Miami, the NEW Miami, is looking to do just that. \nWhat moves, Cam? Who are you talking about? TELL US SOMETHING, CAM!!!!\nOkay okay okay. I got you. Here are the OV�s for the weekend:\nMiami Hurricanes Official Visits\n4-star ATH/RB Mark-Antony Richards. Y�all know the name by now.  Younger brother of former Canes WR Ahmmon Richards, Mark-Antony (who goes by Mark or the nickname MAR � his initials) is a top-tier player in his own right. Miami would obviously like to get him on the team, and his connection to new RB coach Eric Hickson who had previously been recruiting MAR at his previous jobs, could have a positive impact. Auburn, Penn State, Florida and Georgia are all battling with Miami for the multi-talented Wellington (FL) standout. \n3-star S Martin Emerson Jr. Instead of going elsewhere, Emerson Jr. is coming back to Miami for his 2nd OV; this is allowed due to the fact that there was a coaching change at Miami. Things are trending heavily toward the 6�2� Pensacola (FL) Pine Forest standout to flip to Miami from Mississippi State. That could happen this weekend so stay tuned. \n3-star DT Jared Harrison-Hunte. Another player coming in for his 2nd OV to Miami. The 6�4� 286lb NYC native Harrison-Hunte had planned to take a trip to Alabama this weekend, but canceled that on Thursday and instead will be in Coral Gables this weekend. Miami has made decent in-roads in the NYC are with 4-star DT signee Jason Blissett and 3-star OT Adam ElGammal, the latter of whom is teammates with Harrison-Hunte. Look for Miami to try and lock things down with a strong 2nd visit here. \n3-star QB Peyton Matocha. Miami has been looking for a QB in this class, and Matocha may be the guy. This 6�4� Houston native had nearly 3700 yards and 35 TDs with 13 INTs passing and nearly 800 yards with 14 TDs rushing. OC/QB coach Dan Enos visited Matocha this week and Miami is in a good spot to push for a commitment in the near future, if not this weekend.\nMiami is also trying to get 4-star WR George Pickens, an Auburn commit from Hoover (AL), to visit this weekend. No plans along those lines have been made at this time. But, �secret visits� happen all the time, so maybe Pickens comes down this weekend. Or maybe somebody else does. Or maybe not. We�ll see. \nLATE UPDATE: So, between last night (when I wrote this) and this morning, Pickens, who is a newly minted 5-star prospect (bumped up from a consensus 4-star rating), is slated to take a visit to Coral Gables. Miami has been going exclusively after top-tier players at WR, even more than other positions. The Canes have not really looked at any player who isn�t a 5-star or 4-star rated recruit (you can debate the wisdom of that in the comments).\nMiami has missed on a bunch of elite guys: 5-star Jadon Haselwood, 4-star Frank Ladson, 4-star John Dunmore, and more, but Miami did get elite 4-star Jeremiah Payton to sign and enroll early, so that was good. But, the other WR slot, the one to pair WITH Payton has sat empty throughout this class, and Pickens is the latest player Miami is chasing to try and fill that slot. So, getting him on campus for an OV is big. \nBUT, the prevailing thought in the recruiting world is that despite this visit, Pickens will stick with his long-standing commitment to Auburn. I know that�s not optimal for Miami, but getting an OV this late in the game and shooting our metaphorical shot is just about the best-case scenario. And, this is recruiting, where stranger things than Pickens flipping to Miami have happened. So, let�s watch the visit and see what shakes. \nGame on. \nLast thing: there has been no confirmation that either Trevon Hill or Jaelen Phillips will visit Coral Gables this weekend as of the time of this article being composed. So y�all don�t have to ask me about that. \nTargets taking Official Visits Elsewhere\n4-star DE Khris Bogle - Florida. Despite his commitment to Alabama, multiple teams are chasing Bogle, who elected not to sign during the early period in December. Miami sent nearly the entire staff to recruit Bogle recently, and hope to get him back on campus before NSD on February 6. But this weekend, Bogle will be in Gainesville. \n4-star CB Christian Williams - Texas A&M. Like Bogle, Williams is committed to Alabama but taking visits elsewhere. After a stellar trip to Coral Gables last week, the Daphne (AL) native Williams will be in College Station to visit aTm. Every visit is worth watching here as Miami continues to push for a flip. Or try, at least. \n4-star QB Lance LeGendre - Florida State. Miami�s other recent QB offer recipient will be in Tallahassee to visit the Noles. The New Orleans (LA) native has become FSU�s top target, but likely isn�t the same for Miami. FSU will push for a commitment from LeGendre this weekend, and with Miami doing the same with Matocha, both schools could get their 2019 QB commits in the near future. \n4-star CB Kaiir Elam - Colorado. I know, it�s shocking to me, too. North Palm Beach (FL) native and UF legacy Elam is going to Colorado this weekend. The Buffs have had a decent defense recently, but I find it hard to look at this as anything other than a free trip for Elam. Maybe he just wants to go snowboarding or something. \n4-star DE Ja�Darien Boykin - Louisville. A week after visiting Miami, the Gray (GA) Jones County standout Boykin will be in Louisville. The recent chatter has been that Miami is waiting to see what happens with Bogle at DE before taking Boykin, but Louisville probably won�t have the same reservations. Several predictions have Boykin picking Louisville, which could happen either now or on NSD in a week and a half. \nI THINK those are all the away games we have to watch this week, but LMK in the comments if I missed something.\n\nAlright. That�s the visit landscape for this weekend. Vote in the poll and hop in the comments to talk some #crootin�\n\nGo Canes","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:01:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:46Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:01:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721622&p=4s5&v=1&x=q9sOz--PNKvFUm5BD1x8FA","outboundUrls":["https://247sports.com/player/mark-antony-richards-94554/","https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/players/278648/ahmmon-richards","https://247sports.com/player/martin-emerson-jr-46043261/","https://247sports.com/Player/Jared-Harrison-Hunte-46052796","https://247sports.com/player/peyton-matocha-45573446","https://247sports.com/Player/George-Pickens-46043191","https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/players/260145/trevon-hill","https://247sports.com/Player/Khris-Bogle-46038472","https://247sports.com/player/christian-williams-46048941/","https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/players/261637/christian-williams","https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/players/274109/christian-williams","https://247sports.com/player/lance-legendre-86454/","https://247sports.com/player/kaiir-elam-90484/","https://247sports.com/player/jadarien-boykin-46053175/"],"wordCount":"1097","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38349958726","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f500nRZ_lvJ3nZhENMjnVsTs4jg=/136x0:1065x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/62928250/8676859.0.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"UNITED STATES;

Ten years ago, in Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, the state Supreme Court confirmed that the only exceptions to that rule - Business ...ofessions Code section 16600 -- are statutory exceptions, and rejected the \"rule of reasonableness\" that some courts had used to uphold the validity of non-competition covenants. The enforceability of employee non-solicitation contractual provisions was not at issue in Edwards, but the California Court of Appeal in San Diego recently had the opportunity to weigh in on that issue. In AMN Healthcare, Inc. v. Aya Healthcare Services, Inc., the appellate court, in a published decision, invalidated the former employer's employee non-solicitation provision on the ground that it restrained the former employees from practicing their chosen profession. While this ruling may, at first glance, create some doubt about the continued viability of such contractual provisions, a close look at the facts of the AMN Healthcare decision reveals that the outcome depended on very specific circumstances that are not present for most employers using these provisions.AMN and Aya compete in the business of providing healthcare professionals - including \"travel nurses\" -- to medical care facilities on a temporary basis. They employ recruiters to recruit and place travel nurses. AMN required its recruiters to sign a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (CNDA) that among other things prohibited the recruiters, for at least one year, from soliciting AMN employees to leave the company. Specifically, section 3.2 of the CNDA stated: \"Employee covenants and agrees that during Employee's employment with the Company and for a period of eighteen months after the termination of the employment relationship with the Company, Employee shall not directly or indirectly solicit or induce, or cause others to solicit or induce, any employee of the Company or any Company Affiliate to leave the service of the Company or such Company Affiliate.\" (Another version of section 3.2 that was at issue in the case prohibited solicitation for one year after termination of employment.) AMN's position was that this contractual provision prohibited former AMN employees from recruiting travel nurses who were on temporary assignment with AMN.Four AMN recruiters left AMN to join Aya. They recruited several AMN travel nurses to leave AMN assignments and accept assignments through Aya. In response, AMN sued the four former employees for breach of contract and other claims (and also asserted several claims against Aya). As to the contract claim, AMN contended that the defendant employees breached the CNDA by soliciting AMN travel nurses to leave AMN and become Aya employees. In response, the former AMN employees requested dismissal of the contract claim on the basis that the employee non-solicitation provision of the CNDA was an unlawful restraint on trade in violation of section 16600.The Court of Appeal agreed; its reason is critical to understanding the scope of its decision. The court began by reviewing California's well-established law: subject to narrow exceptions, a contract that restrains a person from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business is void. This law furthers the state's public policy favoring employees' mobility and betterment over employers' competitive business interests. Then the court concluded that the non-solicitation provision was unlawful because it prevented the recruiters from doing the very thing that they chose to do as their profession: recruit travel nurses. In so deciding, the court relied on undisputed evidence showing that enforcing the contract would limit the number of nurses with whom the former AMN recruiters could work and, as a result, limit the amount of compensation that the recruiters could earn while employed with their new agency, Aya.Employers should not overreact to the AMN decision. In the vast majority of situations, an employee non-solicitation provision does not prevent a former employee from engaging in their chosen business or trade. Employment agencies and other staffing companies, of course, should promptly review their employee non-solicitation provisions to assess whether they are now in more danger of being invalidated, and make changes accordingly. For all other employers, if your non-solicitation provision has not been evaluated recently, then now is a good time for your FP lawyer to review and ensure that it remains viable under the current state of California law.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Insolvency matters are not entirely arbitrable. Karin GRAF and Brigitte UMBACH-SPAHN explore when a foreign arbitral award can be enforced in Swiss insolvency proceedings against an insolvent defendant. The spectacular bankruptcy of the Swiss national carrier Swissair has spawned a series of decisions of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, which the authors apply to arbitration. Bernhard BERGER, Insolvenz und Schiedsvereinbarung in der Schweiz [Insolvency and Arbitration Agreements in Switzerland][2] This paper presents the Swiss practice concerning insolvency and how it affects arbitration agreements in the international context. About ten years ago, on 31 March 2009, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled in the Vivendi case that foreign insolvency statutes might affect the validity of an arbitration agreement in an international arbitration in Switzerland. A few years later, the Court nuanced this controversial finding (Decision of 16 October 2012, 138 III 714). The risk remains that the issue of insolvency and arbitration agreements rises (again) at the stage of recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award, particularly where enforcement is sought in the country of the lex concursus. BERGER advocates that the provisions of a national bankruptcy law, which aim to invalidate arbitration agreements, should be disregarded in cross-border transactions. This must reasonably apply both in the arbitration and in subsequent enforcement proceedings. Mahutodji Jimmy Vital KODO, Aperu gnral de l'actuel rgime de l'arbitrage OHADA [Overview of the OHADA Arbitration Regime][3] The author provides a general overview of the current OHADA Arbitration legal framework by presenting the regime governing arbitral agreements, the arbitral proceedings and the award and emphasizing the particularities of both the institutional arbitration governed by the Regulation of the CCJA on Arbitration and the Uniform Act on Arbitration. Sami TANNOUS, Matei PURICE, Mohamed KHANATY, The New UAE Federal Arbitration Law:Was it Worth the Wait?[4] The UAE has finally modernised its arbitration framework by promulgating Federal Arbitration Law No 6 of 2018. While the Federal Arbitration Law is largely based on the Model Law, certain changes have created unnecessary ambiguities and uncertainties. A welcome development is the broad powers granted to arbitral tribunals, including the power to issue interim and conservatory measures, and to rule on their own jurisdiction. The authors consider that despite all the ambiguities and a number of missed opportunities, the Federal Arbitration Law is a positive development which will strengthen the UAE's position as a leading regional hub for arbitration. Bernd EHLE, SIA 150:2018 - Modern Swiss Arbitration Rules for Construction Disputes[5] The Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects (SIA), Switzerland's leading professional association for construction, technology and environment specialists, has issued new arbitration rules for construction disputes. The SIA Standard 150:2018 entered into force on 1 January 2018. It features state-of-the-art procedural rules which evidently strive towards efficiency and emphasize settlement facilitation, including through the use of a mandatory instruction hearing at which the arbitral tribunal provides the parties with a preliminary assessment of the case. EHLE presents the most remarkable innovations namely the arbitral tribunal's power to appoint a technical expert as a consultant, and the possibility for the parties to agree on a procedure for an urgent determination of specific legal issues, e.g., whether the employer has the right to order a variation or whether the contractor is entitled to an extension of time for the performance of the works. Daniel GREINEDER, The Limitations of Soft Law Instruments and Good Practice Protocols in International Commercial Arbitration[6] This article considers the value of 'soft law' instruments in international commercial arbitration. It starts from the practical uncertainty arising from the procedural freedom afforded to parties and arbitrators under liberal arbitration legislation. While good practice guidelines may help to overcome this uncertainty and manage parties' expectations, the article identifies the following three difficulties for soft law in achieving this goal: (1) that it is utopian in aspiring to create a transnational legal order; (2) that it is practically unworkable, because it is open to abuse and misunderstanding; and (3) that it is superfluous in stating the painfully obvious. The article concludes by recommending limiting soft law to areas where it is strictly necessary and where a meaningful international consensus can be reached. Stavroula ANGOURA, Interface between Arbitrators' Disclosure and Parties' Investigation Duties[7] In the judgment SAAD Buzwair Automotive Co v. Audi Volkswagen Middle East Fze LLC, the Paris Court of Appeal set aside an ICC arbitral award on the ground of irregular composition of the arbitral tribunal under Article 1520 para. 2 CPC. It found that a co-arbitrator had failed to disclose that his law firm had a relationship with the party's affiliate company in another ongoing dispute. S ANGOURA analyses the judgment and what it means in terms of arbitrators' duty to disclose Caroline DOS SANTOS, The RFC Seraing's Saga Goes on: Arbitration Clause Contained in FIFA's Statutes Held Invalid under Belgian Law[8] Caroline DOS SANTOS reports on a decision of the Brussels Court of Appeal of 29 August 2018 in the RFC Seraing v FIFA saga. RFC Seraing, a Belgian football club, challenged the legality of FIFA's ban on certain Third-Party Ownership ('TPO') agreements. In its decision, the Court while deciding upon its own jurisdiction over the matter, reached the conclusion that the arbitration clause enshrined in the FIFA's Statutes is overly broad and therefore, illegal in the eyes of Belgian law.

The legislation (S-1700[1]), approved by the Senate Environment and Energy Committee, marks the most significant step the state has taken to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and contamination in poor urban communities, according to advocates. 'Environmental injustice is unacceptable and this bill is the first really significant bill to address the lack of environmental equity in communities of color and to give the state the power it needs to stop it,'' said Kim Gaddy, a Newark resident and an organizer for Clean Water Action. The issue, a top environmental priority[2] for the Murphy administration, aims to reverse decades of policy that has left communities of color and low-income populations burdened with an excess of facilities that pollute and handle waste and other contaminants. Newark's Ironbound is a prime example of an environmental justice community, according to Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. Within a section of the community is a cluster of three power plants, a garbage incinerator and three Superfund waste sites. 'For far too long, we have dumped these facilities that no one wants in these communities,'' Tittel said. 'For the first time, this bill puts teeth into environmental justice measures.'' Giving people a sayThe bill sets up a two-tiered system for giving communities more input into the process of siting new or expanded facilities, such as major new air permits for plants, water-treatment facilities, waste-transfer stations and solid-waste facilities. Before any new permit is issued within such a 'burdened community,'' the state Department of Environmental Protection would have to assess the cumulative impact of adding new pollution to the area and hold public hearings. The bill would give the state more authority to deny a permit if the department found it would constitute an unreasonable risk to the health of residents within the community. 'We need to do a better job of where we site these facilities,'' said Sen. Troy Singleton, a Democrat from Burlington County and the sponsor of the bill. The legislation drew opposition from business lobbyists who warned it would add another layer of bureaucracy to a system already burdensome to navigate. 'This bill creates a redundant process that is unnecessary,'' said Dennis Toft, an attorney speaking in behalf of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. 'All this bill accomplishes is add another review process to an already lengthy system.'' Others disagreed. 'We have a serious problem in New Jersey,'' said Nicky Sheats of the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance. 'The amount of pollution in your neighborhood is related to the color of your skin and the money in your pocket. This is unacceptable,'' he said. The original bill included a provision that would have allowed the governing body of a municipality to block the DEP from issuing a permit for a new or expanded facility, but it was deleted by the committee.

Sound familiar? Sound like something the Supreme Court rejected in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court, 137 S. Ct. 1773 (2017). It should. So, why are we here again? I guess you can credit plaintiffs' counsel with persistence. But you what they say about the definition of insanity? Well, it's getting close to that point.In BMS, the Supreme Court held that California's courts could not exercise specific personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant unless there is \"an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.\" Id. at 1781 (2017). That means there must be a causal link between the defendant's forum contacts and the alleged injury to the plaintiff. Contacts with other people do not count. And while BMS primarily focused on the contacts of resident versus non-resident plaintiffs, it also says that the presence of a California distributor - equally uninvolved with the plaintiffs who brought the suit - does not change the result one iota. \"The bare fact that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.\" Id. at 1783.But plaintiffs in In re Amiodarone Cases, No. JCCP 4956, slip op.[1] (Cal. Super. Jan. 10, 2019) may not have been paying close enough attention to that portion of the decision. When defendant manufacturers challenged the lack of personal jurisdiction over the claims of non-residents, plaintiffs relied exclusively on the manufacturers' relationship with an in-state distributor. BMS wasn't decided that long ago as to have been forgotten already? No, the court remembered it quite accurately.Plaintiffs, whose claims were premised on allegations of off-label use and failure to provide the Medication Guide, argued that the supply agreements entered into by the drug manufacturers and the California-based distributor conferred specific personal jurisdiction because they contained provisions agreeing the contracts were governed by California law. But that didn't amount to a contact related to plaintiffs' lawsuit that would give rise to personal jurisdiction. The choice of law provision applied to disputes over the contract, not plaintiffs' products liability claims. Id. at 7. Additional provisions of the supply agreements provided that California law applied and California was the appropriate venue for disputes regarding the indemnification requirements of the agreements. Those provisions even said that for such disputes, the parties agreed to waive personal jurisdiction and inconvenient forum arguments. Id. at 7-8. Despite the plain language of the agreements, plaintiffs tried to argue that those provisions should equally apply to the underlying claims that may trigger the indemnification provisions. And once again the court reiterated that the contractual obligations between the manufacturers and distributor was \"not evidence of a contact for jurisdictional purposes.\" Id. at 8.But plaintiffs pressed on. They also argued that they were third-party beneficiaries under the supply agreements and therefore could enforce the personal jurisdiction waiver. Id. But just because the supply agreements set up the chain of distribution that may have ultimately led to plaintiffs ingesting the drug did not make plaintiffs third-party beneficiaries. Moreover, the waiver was \"expressly limited\" to indemnification disputes and so wouldn't apply to products liability actions anyway. Id.Choice of law didn't work. Third-party beneficiary didn't work. What about compliance clauses? The supply agreements contained compliance clauses that stated that the drugs shall comply with all governing laws and regulations, will not be adulterated or misbranded, and will comply with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Id. at 8-9. But again, the court found those clauses don't run to plaintiffs or their claims and so can't be used to establish specific personal jurisdiction.If not the supply agreements, what about compliance with regulations? Plaintiffs argued that manufacturers were required to provide the California distributor with the Medication Guide which it in turn was required to distribute to physicians and pharmacies. This, they claimed, evidenced a sufficient connection between California and the non-resident plaintiffs' claims. Id. at 9. But, going back to BMS, that a manufacturer has business transactions with third-parties isn't sufficient. To satisfy due process, a defendant must be \"haled into court in a forum state based on its own affiliations with the State, not based on the 'random, fortuitous, or attenuated' contacts he makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with the State\" Id. Here, plaintiffs have more than enough evidence to establish a relationship between the manufacturers and their supplier, but they've offered no evidence to take the leap of a connection to the non-resident plaintiffs. There is no evidence that any non-resident plaintiff took Amiodarone distributed by any California-based distributor. Id.What about derivative liability? Plaintiffs argued, but offered no authority to support, that the indemnification provisions in the supply agreement create derivative liability by manufacturers for conduct of McKesson. Id. at 10. The best plaintiffs could come up with here was to rely on California's old sliding scale approach to personal jurisdiction. But that was expressly rejected by BMS.Finally, what about the fact that the manufacturers sold the drug to the distributor in California? It's irrelevant because it's completely unconnected to the plaintiffs.Call it persistence. Call it \"E\" for effort. Call it insanity. If the question of personal jurisdiction via third-party contacts wasn't sufficiently answered in BMS (by the way, it was), In re Amiodarone should be viewed as shutting the door for good in California.This article is presented for informational purposes only and is not intended to constitute legal advice.

The first EU-wide 'digital contracts' rules to protect consumers better were provisionally agreed by Parliament and Council negotiators this week. These consumer protection rights will apply in an equal manner to consumers who provide data in exchange for such content or service and to 'paying' consumers alike. What to do if something goes wrong The agreed text lays down that: In case of defective digital content or service: if it is not possible to fix it in a reasonable time, the consumer is entitled to a price reduction or a full reimbursement within 14 days; if a defect becomes apparent within one year of the date of supply, it is presumed that it existed already at that time, without the need for the consumer to prove it (reversal of the burden of proof); for continuous supplies, the burden of proof remains with the trader throughout the contract; the guarantee period for one-off supplies cannot be shorter than two years; for continuous supplies it should apply throughout the duration of the contract,and; for subscriptions to digital content for a period of time, the trader may modify the content only if it's allowed by the contract, the consumer is notified reasonably in advance and is allowed to terminate the contract within at least 30 days of notice. Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee Rapporteur Evelyne Gebhardt (S...DE) [1]said: 'With the sinking cost of electronic gadgets and the growing market for Big Data and targeted marketing, companies have an increased incentive to distribute consumer electronics without charge. Some consumer electronics are sold at the manufacturing price or less. The main purpose of such 'giveaways' is to monetize through collection of user-generated content. This provisional deal bolsters consumer rights and increases legal certainty. It addresses the most pressing issues that consumer contracts in the digital sphere face today, such as software updates, changes to digital content/service, and terminating long-term contracts.' Legal Affairs Committee Rapporteur Axel Voss (EPP, DE) [2]added: 'The directive for digital contract law provides an essential legal framework for digital content within the EU. Most notably in the digital world, which is characteriszd by a boundless data transfer between countries, it is indispensable for a functioning European Single Market to adopt uniform rules.' Next steps MEPs have provisionally closed the negotiations on the digital content directive today. The agreement should be officially confirmed when a deal is reached on its 'twin' proposal, the sales of goods directive, since the co-legislators decided to treat them as a package. The provisional agreement will need to be confirmed by member states' ambassadors (Coreper) and the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and Legal Affairs committees. It will then be put to a vote by the full House and submitted for approval to the EU Council of Ministers. Background Contracts for the supply of digital content and services are concluded every day by millions of people. Digital content covers a wide range of items, such as music, movies, apps, games and computer programmes. Digital services include, for instance, cloud computing services and social media platforms. EU data protection rules will be fully applicable in the context of these 'digital contracts'. Goods with digital elements (e.g. 'smart' fridges or connected watches) are to be regulated under the directive on sales of goods, on which negotiations are ongoing. This proposal, together with the one on the sales of tangible goods, is among the initiatives of the Digital Single Market Strategy.

Tips For Enjoying a Day in the Cozumel Cruise Port With Your Family","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Dotting The Map: http://www.dottingthemap.com Delivered by Newstex)  Wandering in the Palm Grove, Paradise Beach Club Cozumel If you happen to be so lucky to have the cruise port of Cozumel on your upcoming itinerary and you haven't been before, know you are in for a good time. Cozumel is a beautiful island located just 12 miles east of mainland of Mexico (Cancun). It's a versatile cruise destination with things to do for everyone in the family regardless of their interests. There are historic sights, beautiful beaches, boating, sailing and snorkeling excursions, amazing beaches, shopping, and delicious food.We had so much fun visiting Cozumel on our recent Carnival Cruise with our family. We were a little concerned at first because we felt Cozumel had a party reputation but we were put at ease and realized what an amazing family friendly destination it can be.Related PostsEverything You Need to Know About Cruising Carnival[1]BookthePerfectVacationinCostaRica[2] Things You Should Know Before Taking Your Family to CozumelYou still shouldn't drink the tap water in Cozumel, but if you go to any of the restaurants and resorts you will be fine getting ice and drinking water. They typically use purified water. If it still makes you nervous you can ask for bottles or you can skip it.Always plan on being back at the cruise port (and on the ship) 30 minutes before you have to leave. This is of course so you can ensure that the boat doesn't leave you. It also gives you time to watch the runners and the cruisers who spent a little too much time at the bar.Cozumel is a Caribbean island and the sun will be stronger than you may be used to. Remember sunscreen, sun shirts, and hats. You'll want to reapply sunscreen more often than you probably do at home. Make sure to pack a beach bag when you get off the ship. Don't forget to bring your cruise beach towels that are provided for you in your stateroom if you plan on soaking up some sun. Pool chair clips, beach bag, and aloe will be helpful. While the taxi rates may appear to be set to your destinations there is a little wiggle room. We were able to negotiate our taxi rates to out of port quite a bit out but not very much on the way back. You may just need to be a little patient.The official currency in Mexico is the Peso but they widely accept the American dollar. There is no reason to make an exchange prior.Also, something to note is that if you came from another time zone rather than Eastern time zone your cruise departure time will go off your ship's time not local port time. That can get confusing so keep your eye on the time, you may need to adjust for your cruise time.Family Friendly Excursions in Cozumel There are so many great options to choose from for family friendly Cozumel shore excursions. We have four kids ages 9,7,5 and 3 so we were really looking for a laid back option where we could enjoy family time and relax. Preferably on a beautiful beach so we started searching beaches in Cozumel near cruise port. Other families we know enjoyed dune buggies, snorkeling, and other great adventures. You can book directly excursions with your cruise line or you can book with a local operator directly.We love booking with Viator as we feel they are a trustworthy tour company and always provide great experiences for a value price. Check out some of our favorite Cozumel excursions with Viator[3].After a lot of research, we decided we wanted to check out Paradise Beach which is a private beach club open to the public. There are many beach clubs that cater specifically to cruise passengers. They offer showers, changing facilities, food and drink service and of course access to a great beach and a large pool. Some of these Beach clubs looked like they were geared more towards adults or young adults and we definitely wanted to stick with something with more of a family vibe.Paradise Beach Club is a great option for an easy and fun family shore excursion in Cozumel! View this post on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/BqqJ-eqlVmS/?utm_source=ig_embed..._medium=loading How about a day in Paradise? If you ask my kids what their favorite cruise port was on our recent #carnivalcruise they will hands down say Cozumel. We spent the majority of the day enjoying the beautiful beach and pool amenities at @paradisebeachcozumel the food, the pool, the view I don't think you could ask for a better day. We loved it because it's easily accessible from the port with a quick taxi ride and there is so much to do there. By far the most affordable and family friendly beach club on Cozumel. We will be back! #hosted . . . . . . . #cozumel #cruising #cruisingcarnival #choosefun #cruise #cruiselife #travelingfamily #familytravel #familytraveltribe #familytravelblogger #nomad #digitalnomad #laptoplifestyle #parentswhowander #carribbean #beach #instabeach #lpkids #vacay #vacationmode #kidswhotravel #alwaysonthego #nomadfamily #digitalnomadfamily[4] A post shared by Reid and Hilarye Fuller[5] (@dottingthemap) on Nov 26, 2018 at 1:30pm PST We love that to get to Paradise Beach Club[6] it was only a 12-minute taxi ride from the cruise port. Once you depart your cruise ship and walk through a decorated shopping area you will find the taxi line. Here you can line up and hosts will match you with a taxi driver. It was not crowded when we went and we were able to negotiate a fair price for our family of six.A short taxi ride later and we stepped foot in Paradise Beach. Another thing I love about this Cozumel family-friendly beach club is that it's easy on the budget. They only charge $3 a person for the use of their facilities which include a lounge chair, umbrella, pool access, beach access, and free wi-fi. A $10 minimum food or drink purchase is required during your visit which was easy to accomplish as we sampled delicious nachos, street tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. They also have bar drinks and of course virgin drinks for those not drinking and the kiddos. Mexican food plus a beach equals the perfect day in my book. Water Features at Paradise Beach Club, Photo Courtesy of Paradise Beach Unfortunately, the day we went to Paradise Beach it was really windy. On a normal basis, Paradise Beach offers a Fun-Pass for an additional $15 fee that allows access to a bunch of fun inflatables. These including a multi-tiered climbing structure, blast bag, water trampolines, slides, and so much more. These probably wouldn't have been appropriate for younger kids but my 9-year-old and 7-year old would have loved climbing all over them. You also get full access to kayaks, snorkel gear, stand up paddle boards too. This is a steal compared to other beach clubs on the island.When I think about the term budget-friendly beach club, I was a little concerned even though the pictures looked gorgeous. When I arrived, I was blown away. The facilities were clean and well taken care of and the property exceeded my expectations. All of the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I really felt like I was at a resort on vacation. Although we spent a good amount of time by the beach and playing in the sand we loved the heated pool and sipping frozen fruit drinks while dancing to music and lounging.Before we knew it, it was time to pack up and leave. We were sad to go but grateful for the fun relaxing day we had. After picking up a taxi right out front we were quickly shuttled back to the port. Speaking of taxis, there are always plenty waiting to take people back so you don't have to worry. We even had extra time so we did some souvenir shopping before we headed back to the ship.Cozumel is a beautiful island and if you have the opportunity to cruise there someday I highly recommend it. It's great for families to enjoy time together in a beautiful place.Our visit to Paradise Beach Club was hosted, as always our opinions are our own.

Chegou-se ao ponto de mostrar linhas imagin�rias para se tentar ludibriar o telespectador levando-o a acreditar que um fora de jogo perfeitamente inventado pudesse ser aceite como uma boa decis�o. Nesse e noutros lances, semana ap�s semana, este funcion�rio com agenda pr�pria prestou um p�ssimo servi�o � defesa da arbitragem e � necess�ria isen��o da Sport TV � que lhe deu a possibilidade de ser o rosto de um programa (Ju�zo Final) anunciado como um espa�o de excel�ncia para fazer pedagogia e escalpelizar, de forma cristalina, os lances mais pol�micos. Hoje, finalmente, a m�scara caiu. No mesmo sentido, o pior que poderia acontecer s�o todas estas tentativas de quem continua a fingir que nada de grave se passou nas meias-finais da Ta�a da Liga. N�o foi a (excelente) qualidade de jogo que desprestigiou o futebol portugu�s. Foram, sim, as decis�es incompreens�veis que colocaram em causa a verdade desportiva. Os primeiros interessados em que isto n�o se repita deveriam ser, precisamente, os �rbitros. Em defesa da classe e do prest�gio de cada um. Meter a cabe�a debaixo da areia seria o pior que poderia acontecer. � preciso encarar a realidade e admitir que, infelizmente, h� sinais muito s�rios de que est� em curso uma tentativa de regresso aos tempos do Apito Dourado.\nFalemos de coisas que, verdadeiramente, contribuem para o prest�gio do futebol portugu�s: foi com orgulho que vimos esta semana dois estudos internacionais, um da UEFA e outro da Deloitte, demonstrar e provar de forma inequ�voca a qualidade do trabalho realizado nestes �ltimos anos na gest�o do nosso clube.\nNa UEFA, em estudo conhecido na passada semana, o Benfica surge em 7 rankings (Top 20), destacando-se claramente como o clube portugu�s mais referenciado. Ontem, em relat�rio divulgado pela Deloitte, ficou a saber-se que somos o �nico clube portugu�s no Top 30 dos que geraram mais receita na Europa e um dos �nicos 3 fora do poderoso �Big Five� (Inglaterra, Espanha, Alemanha, Fran�a e It�lia).\nResultados de um trabalho �rduo, profissional e meticuloso que � reconhecido a n�vel internacional e que, naturalmente, prestigia o futebol portugu�s.\nQuem tanto fala na necessidade de preservar a galinha dos ovos de ouro deveria p�r os olhos neste exemplo e garantir a preserva��o de competi��es com regras claras, crit�rios transparentes e onde se fa�a, acima de tudo, a defesa da qualidade do espect�culo.

The first proposal is to allow fishermen and operators from member states to receive compensation under theEuropean Maritime and Fisheries Fundfor the temporary cessation of fishing activities. This will help off-set some of the impact of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU fishing vessels in a no-deal scenario. The second proposal amends theRegulationon the Sustainable Management of the External Fleets. The aim of this proposal is to ensure that the EU is in a position to grant UK vessels access to EU waters until the end of 2019, on the condition that EU vessels are also granted reciprocal access to UK waters. The proposal also provides for a simplified procedure to authorize UK vessels to fish in EU waters and EU vessels to fish in UK waters - should the UK grant that access. This proposal is limited to 2019 and is based on the agreement in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of 17 and 18 December 2018 on the fishing opportunities for 2019. These contingency measures cannot mitigate the overall impact of a 'no-deal' scenario, nor do they in any way replicate the full benefits of EU membership or the terms of any transition period, as provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement. They are limited to these specific areas where it is absolutely necessary to protect the vital interests of the EU and where preparedness measures on their own are not sufficient. As a rule, they will be temporary in nature, limited in scope and adopted unilaterally by the EU. Next steps These proposals are subject to the co-decision procedure. The Commission will work with the European Parliament and the Council to ensure the adoption of the proposed legislative acts so that they are in force by 29 March 2019. Background On 19 December 2018, the Commission published itsthird Brexit preparedness Communication[1], which implemented its 'no-deal' Contingency Action Plan. This Communication included 14 measures in a limited number of areas where a 'no-deal' scenario would create major disruption for citizens and businesses in the EU27. These areas include financial services, air transport, customs, and climate policy, amongst others. The Commission has also published 88sector-specific preparedness notices to inform the public about the consequences of the UK's withdrawal in the absence of any Withdrawal Agreement. These are available in all official EU languages. The Commission has also held technical discussions with the EU27 Member States both on general issues of preparedness and on specific sectorial, legal and administrative preparedness steps. The slides used in these technical seminars are availableonline[2]. The Commission will continue to implement its Contingency Action Plan in the weeks to come and will monitor the need for additional action, as well as continue to support member states in their preparedness work.

- EU negotiators agree on new rules for sharing of public sector data","content":"Jan 25, 2019( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  The European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the Commission have reached a political agreement on a revised directive that will facilitate the availability and re-use of public sector data.In full compliance with theEU General Data Protection Regulation[1], thenew Directive on Open Data and Public Sector Information (PSI)[2]- which can be for example anything from anonymised personal data on household energy use to general information about national education or literacy levels - updates the framework setting out the conditions under which public sector data should be made available for re-use, with a particular focus on the increasing amounts of high-value data that is now available.  Digital Single Market Vice President AndrusAnsipsaid:'Data is increasingly the lifeblood of today's economy and unlocking the potential of public open data can bring significant economic benefits. The total direct economic value of public sector information and data from public undertakings is expected to increase from �52 billion in 2018 to �194 billion by 2030. With these new rules in place, we will ensure that we can make the most of this growth'. Digital Economy and Society Commissioner MariyaGabrielsaid:'Public sector information has already been paid for by the taxpayer. Making it more open for re-use benefits the European data economy by enabling new innovative products and services, for example based on artificial intelligence technologies. But beyond the economy, open data from the public sector is also important for our democracy and society because it increases transparency and supports a facts-based public debate.' The European Parliament and the Council will now need to formally adopt the revised rules.For more information see thepress release[3]and updatedfactsheet[4].

Sie auf dem Kreuzfahrtschiff keine wei�e Kleidung anziehen sollten","content":"Auf einer Kreuzfahrt gibt es einiges zu beachten, was unerfahrene Passagiere nicht wissen. Dazu z�hlt auch das Tragen wei�er Kleidung, das Sie unterlassen sollten.\n\nMeist tr�gt der Kapit�n eines Schiffes eine wei�e Uniform und der Gedanke liegt nah, sich auf der Kreuzfahrt maritim zu kleiden. Doch von wei�er Kleidung sollten Passagiere oftmals absehen.\n\nWei�e Kleidung auf der Kreuzfahrt: Wann sie keine gute Idee ist\n\nGut gekleidet auf dem Kreuzfahrtschiff entlang spazieren, wei�es Hemd, wei�e Leinenhose - das klingt elegant und passend. Doch vor allem im hinteren Teil des Schiffes ist die Kleiderwahl in Form von wei�er Segelmode oder dem wei�en Sommerkleid keine wirklich gut Idee. \n\nDenn an der hinteren Seite des Kreuzfahrtschiffes befindet sich meist der Schornstein. Aus ihm fliegen gern einmal Ru�partikel durch die Luft. Sind Sie dann zur falschen zeit am falschen Ort, ist die wei�e Kleidung schnell ruiniert: Es bilden sich unsch�ne Flecken auf Kleidern, Hosen, Blusen und Hemden. Auch wer sich mit einem wei�en Bademantel auf den Weg zum Heck macht, um sich eine Runde zu sonnen, der sollte gewarnt sein: Auch hier werden die Ru�partikel das wei�e, flauschige Material nicht verschonen.\n\nNat�rlich ist wei�e Kleidung bedenkenlos zu tragen, wenn es etwa ins Restaurant oder zu einer Veranstaltung auf dem Boot geht. Nicht selten werden sogar \"wei�e N�chte\" w�hrend der Kreuzfahrt veranstaltet. Sie k�nnen also problemlos etwas Wei�es einpacken, wenn Sie in See stechen - w�hlen Sie die Garderobe jedoch eben mit Bedacht. \n\nGerade f�r Paare, die gerne auf der Kreuzfahrt heiraten m�chten, ist dies ein wichtiger Hinweis. Welche Braut will schon in einem wei�en Kleid feiern, das von Ru�flecken benetzt ist?Gibt es Kleidervorschriften auf dem Kreuzfahrtschiff?\n\nBez�glich der Kleidung auf einer Kreuzfahrt gilt generell: Sie ben�tigen keine Abendgarderobe, kein Ballkleid oder Frack. Sie sollten jedoch auch darauf verzichten, im Restaurant mit Flip-Flops, kurzen Hosen oder Unterhemden zu erscheinen.\n\nM�nner sollten zu langen Hosen, Poloshirt und einem leichten Pullover greifen, w�hrend Frauen mit Hosen und Tops oder aber einem Kleid eine gute Figur machen.

The decision would only be implemented once approved by Parliament and Council. Once the member state remedies the deficits identified by the EU Commission, Parliament and EU ministers could unlock the funds. Independent experts to assist the European Commission The European Commission may establish that the rule of law is under threat, if one or more of the following are undermined: Proper functioning of the authorities of the member state implementing the EU budget; proper functioning of the authorities carrying out financial control; proper investigation of fraud - including tax fraud -, corruption or other breaches affecting the implementation of the EU budget; effective judicial review by independent courts; recovery of funds unduly paid; preventing and penalising tax evasion and tax competition, and; co-operation with the European Anti-Fraud Office and, if applicable, the European Public Prosecutor's Office. To assist the Commission, a panel of independent experts in constitutional law and financial matters, comprising one expert appointed by the national parliament of each member state and five named by the European Parliament, would assess the situation in all member states on a yearly basis and make a public summary of its findings. Protecting final beneficiaries Depending on the scope of the shortcomings and the budget management procedure, the Commission can decide on one or several measures, including: Suspending commitments; interrupting payment deadlines; reducing pre-financing, and; suspending payments. Unless the decision states otherwise, the government would still have to implement the respective EU programme or fund and make payments to final beneficiaries, like researchers or civil society organizations. The Commission would have to assist the beneficiaries and strive to make sure they receive the due amounts. The Commission would submit a proposal to Parliament and EU ministers to transfer an amount matching the value of the proposed measures to the budgetary reserve. The decision would take effect after four weeks, unless Parliament, acting by majority of votes cast, or Council, acting byqualified majority[1](so no single member state can block a decision), amend or reject it. Once the EU Commission establishes that the deficits have been lifted, the locked amount would be unfrozen using the same procedure. Committee on Budgets co-rapporteurEider Gardiazabal Rubial[2](S...ES) said: 'The respect of rule of law and all EU values are core principles upon which we built the European project. No government can violate those values without suffering the consequences.' Budgetary Control Committee co-rapporteurPetri Sarvamaa[3](EPP, FI) said: 'The most important aspect of this mechanism is the protection of the final beneficiaries - in our model, this is strengthened as compared to the original Commission proposal. We have also included the European Parliament in the decision-making procedure, thus strengthening the democratic accountability of any measures taken.' Next Steps The Plenary endorsed the rules by 397 votes to 158, with 69 abstentions. MEPs are now ready to enter negotiations on the final wording of the regulation with the EU ministers, who have not adopted their position yet. Background The proposal for the regulation 'On the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States' is an integral part of the EU's long-term budget package, the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework.

coach critical of Sala search being called off","content":"Nantes coach Vahid Halilhodzic called it \"a total disgrace\" and \"disgusting\" that the search for the missing plane carrying soccer player Emiliano Sala was called off. \n\nThe search for Sala and the pilot of a small passenger plane going from Nantes to Cardiff on Monday was called off after a three-day air-and-sea operation near the Channel Islands failed to locate the aircraft. The plane disappeared from radar over the English Channel. \n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Friday, Halilhodzic expressed his anger at the decision to stop. The plane was last known to be flying near Hurd's Deep, an underwater valley which has a depth of more than 100 meters (328 feet). \n\n\"For me it's a disgrace to stop like this. I don't think it's enormously deep not to be able to find it. It's an obligation these people have,\" Halilhodzic said. \"You can't just stay like this. It's a total disgrace. You can't leave it this way. To stop like this is unbearable and unacceptable. Can you imagine the family? Yesterday did you see how his sister expressed herself?\" \n\nSpeaking in Cardiff on Thursday, Sala's sister Romina Sala said: \"Please, please, I'm asking you � don't stop searching. They're alive.\" \n\nA growing social media petition, including some Argentina players, has also asked for the search to go on. \n\nHalilhodzic repeated the request on Friday. \n\n\"I just have one message to those responsible, that they continue their search because it's disgusting to leave a situation like that,\" he said. \"It's unbearable. I can't imagine how his family is taking this.\" \n\nHalilhodzic was one of the best strikers in Nantes history with 111 goals, and fans voted the former Yugoslavia international into their best-ever team. Known as a strict disciplinarian, he admired Sala for his work ethic and constant desire to improve. \n\nThe player-coach partnership was paying off, too. Sala was enjoying the best season of his career before joining Cardiff, scoring 12 league goals in 19 games and cementing his high reputation among fans as a hard-working and unselfish player. \n\nHalilhodzic was visibly moved as he spoke about Sala. \n\n\"I had a special relationship with this lad, because we spoke a lot together, worked a lot together,\" he said. \"The last thing he said to me was he regretted we could no longer work together and that remains engraved deep in my heart.\" \n\nHe urged his team to win Sunday's French Cup game at Sannois Saint-Gratien. \n\n\"I think the players have an obligation to him to show character. We're all a bit shocked but you have to carry on living and moving forward,\" Halilhodzic said. \"But we will never forget him. We all have a debt and the best way to thank him is to win.\" \n\nBut some players, who were particularly close to Sala, may not be ready to play. \n\n\"It's a difficult game, emotionally, on a human level,\" Halilhodzic said. \"I will need to speak to two or three players on an individual level to see if they can play. This is more of a psychological, mental preparation than anything else.\" \n\nFor now, the club has not employed psychologists to help the players cope. But Halilhodzic said it was a viable option. \n\n\"I know that in certain situations like this people use them,\" he said. \"It's difficult for me to judge the state of each player. If we need it, we can use this type of treatment.\" \n\nBecause of the grief around Sala's disappearance, Halilhodzic added, total unity is needed. \n\n\"I want us to stick together. If you see someone in distress you can help them, speak to them,\" he said. \"I am asking everyone at the club to be even closer to the players, to talk together. I think this is the best way of getting through this.\" \n\n___ \n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:33:52Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:45Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:33:52Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721538&p=4s5&v=1&x=EdesbrrLDb-l3mBOUtG8Ww","outboundUrls":["https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer","https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"],"wordCount":"631","dataFormat":"text","loginStatus":"sub","duplicateGroupId":"38350530896","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a8fce9e5c4bb2b6e4950d058219ff276cabcb4a9/c=0-185-3583-2200/local/-/media/2019/01/25/USATODAY/usatsports/15437fc6c76f45edbf8461dc7c8cb242.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"ETHICS","score":"75"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"ATHLETES","score":"72"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"SOCCER","score":"89"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"PRESS CONFERENCES","score":"70"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"COACHES & TRAINERS","score":"78"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"AIRCRAFT PILOTS","score":"77"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"CHANNEL ISLANDS","score":"57"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"ENGLAND","score":"78"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"FRANCE","score":"79"}],"companies":[],"locations":[{"name":"Nantes","type":"city","mentions":"4","country":{},"state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"Cardiff","type":"city","mentions":"3","country":{"fipsCode":"UK","isoCode":"gb","name":"United Kingdom"},"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"Argentina","type":"country","mentions":"1","country":{"fipsCode":"AR","isoCode":"ar","name":"Argentina"},"region":"Americas","subregion":"South America","state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"Yugoslavia","type":"country","mentions":"1","country":{},"state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"French","type":"country","mentions":"1","country":{"fipsCode":"FR","isoCode":"fr","name":"France"},"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"Channel Islands","type":"landform","mentions":"1","country":{},"state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"}],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Romina Sala"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Romina Sala"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.998"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"Cardiff Blues"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Cardiff"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.876"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Vahid Halilhod�ic"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Vahid Halilhodzic"},{"name":"instances","value":"9"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.995"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"F.C.

Amendments To The Hungarian Land Act","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The amendments of the Act on the Transactions in Agricultural and Forestry Land (Land Act) entered into force on 11 January 2019. Based on the new rules, in the approval procedure of the sale and purchase agreement for agricultural lands, the regional entity of the Hungarian Chamber of Agriculture as local land committee will prepare an opinion whether the sale and purchase agreement is in compliance with the aspects included in the Land Act (e.g. transparency of the relationship of tenures, preventing speculative land acquisition). The amendment determines the conditions that shall be considered in the course of the assessment of the compliance with these aspects, such as the purchase price of the land, the lands already owned by the purchaser, or how the sale and purchase of the land serves the acquisition of ownership of young farmers or new agricultural producers.The amended Land Act reforms the pre-emption rights of the farmers keeping animals, and the scope of persons having pre-emption right or the right of first refusal has been extended by persons performing horticultural activities or producing propagating materials.The amendment introduces stricter rules for checking the performance of the obligations undertaken by the purchaser and determined as a condition for the acquisition of lands and for the legal consequences of the omission. In case the obligor breaches the restrictions of the acquisition, as a first step he/she must comply within six months with the conditions that are necessary for the maintenance of the lawful status. Failing this obligation, in case of a sale and purchase agreement, as a new legal consequence the Land Act establishes call option right by the rule of law for the persons having pre-emption right or for the Hungarian State on the land affected.According to the amendments, from 11 January 2019, no share-cropping (\"feles brleti\" in Hungarian) or share-farming (\"rszmuvelsi\" in Hungarian) agreement may be concluded, and the agreements already existing on the date of entering into force the amendment of the Land Act will be terminated on 31 December 2028 by the rule of law.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The CCPA was passed quickly by California lawmakers in an effort to remove a ballot initiative of the same name from the November 6, 2018, statewide ballot. The CCPA likely will require businesses, including retailers, to make significant changes to their data protection programs, if the business has consumers or employees who are California residents.Key provisions of the CCPA include:Applicability. The CCPA will apply to any for-profit business that: (1) \"does business in the state of California\"; (2) \"collects consumers' personal information, or on the behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers' personal information\"; and (3) satisfies one or more of the following thresholds: (a) has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million; (b) alone or in combination, annually buys, receives for the business's commercial purposes, sells or shares for commercial purposes, the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices; or (c) derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information (collectively, Businesses).Definition of Consumer. The CCPA defines \"consumer\" as a natural person who is a California resident.Definition of Personal Information. Personal information is defined broadly as \"information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\" The CCPA's definition of personal information also contains a list of enumerated examples of personal information, which includes, among other data elements, name, postal or email address, Social Security number, governmentissued identification number, biometric data, Internet activity information and geolocation data, as well as \"inferences drawn from any of the information identified\" in this definition.Definition of Sale. The CCPA broadly defines sale as \"selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.\" The law provides several enumerated exceptions detailing activities that do not constitute a \"sale\" under the CCPA.Privacy Policies. The CCPA will require certain disclosures in businesses' online privacy notices, including a description of consumers' rights under the CCPA (e.g., the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information). Businesses must also disclose certain data practices from the preceding 12 months about the categories of personal information collected about consumers, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information and the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information. If the Business sells consumers' personal information or discloses it to third parties for a business purpose, the notice must also include lists of the categories of personal information sold or disclosed about consumers in the preceding 12 months.Access Right. Upon a verifiable request from a consumer, a business must disclose: (1) the categories and specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about that consumer; (2) the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (3) the business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal information; and (4) the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information. A Business that sells a consumer's personal information or discloses it for a business purpose must also disclose: (1) the categories of personal information that the business sold about the consumer; (2) the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold (by category of personal information for each third party to whom the personal information was sold); and (3) the categories of personal information that the business disclosed about the consumer for a business purposeDeletion Right. The CCPA will require a business, upon verifiable request from a consumer, to delete personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer and direct any service providers to delete the consumer's personal information. There are several enumerated exceptions to this requirement, two of which broadly state that compliance with a deletion request is not required when \"it is necessary for the business or service provider to maintain the consumer's personal information\" to: (1) \"enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer's relationship with the business\" or (2) \"use the consumer's personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.\"Opt-Out Right. Businesses must provide a clear and conspicuous link on their website that says \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" and provide consumers a mechanism to opt out of the sale of their personal information, a decision which the Business must respect.Specific Rules for Minors. If a business has actual knowledge that a consumer is less than 16 years of age, the CCPA prohibits a business from selling that consumer's personal information unless: (1) the consumer is between 13-16 years of age and has affirmatively authorized the sale (i.e., they have opted in); or (2) the consumer is less than 13 years of age and the consumer's parent or guardian has affirmatively authorized the sale.Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentives. Businesses cannot discriminate against consumers for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA. Businesses can, however, offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of personal information.Enforcement.The CCPA is enforceable by the California AG and authorizes a civil penalty up to $2,500 for each violation or $7,500 for each intentional violation.The CCPA provides a private right of action only in connection with certain \"unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure\" of a consumer's nonencrypted or nonredacted personal information, as defined in the state's breach notification law, if the business failed \"to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information.\" The consumer may bring an action to recover damages up to $750 per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.Due to the CCPA's likely effect on the data protection programs of many businesses that have California consumers or employees, it is imperative that retailers develop a CCPA compliance strategy to determine the extent to which the law applies to them, assess their current CCPA compliance posture and conduct any necessary remediation activities.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

It unanimously found that the proposed national securities regulatory regime, the National Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System (Cooperative System), is constitutional. This decision will allow the Federal Government and a coalition of participating provinces, which currently does not include Alberta, Quebec, or Manitoba, to establish a national scheme for regulating securities in Canada.The SCC considered two questions:Does the Constitution authorize the implementation of pan-Canadian securities regulations under the authority of a single regulator, according to the model established by the Memorandum of Agreement regarding the Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory System (the Agreement)?Does the draft of the federal Capital Markets Stability Act exceed the authority of the Parliament of Canada over the general branch of the trade and commerce power under the Constitution Act, 1867? The Court found that the Cooperative System does not violate the principles of parliamentary sovereignty, nor does it hinder the law making powers of participating provincial legislatures. It also found that the proposed federal statute falls within Parliament's power over general trade and commerce as it deals only with matters of national concern.What effect this decision will have on the regulation of securities in Canada remains to be seen. Alberta continues to oppose the consolidation of securities oversight in a national regulator. The effect this decision has on Alberta will depend on whether the Federal Government and the participating provinces have the political will to pursue the initiative and, if so, whether the interface between the new federal regulator and the non-participating provinces will continue to allow the regulatory regime in Canada to operate in an efficient and harmonized manner.Background to the Establishment of the Cooperative SystemPrevious SCC decisions have confirmed that the constitutional division of provincial and federal powers grants the provinces the authority to legislate on the day-to-day intra-provincial trade of securities. This has resulted in each province and territory establishing their own securities regulatory authority. Over the years, the various regulatory regimes across Canada have largely been harmonized and there is cooperation between the regulatory authorities to streamline and reduce commercial parties' interactions with multiple authorities across the country. The provincial and territorial securities regulatory authorities have also established the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), an umbrella organization that coordinates policy and regulatory change to promote this harmonization and cooperation.In a 2011 reference, the SCC unanimously found that a proposed federal Securities Act, which sought to establish a national scheme for the regulation of capital markets, administered by a single national securities regulator, would be unconstitutional. The Court held that because the proposed legislation purported to regulate all aspects of the trade of securities in Canada, it encroached on the provinces jurisdiction over property and civil rights. However, the Court acknowledged that certain aspects of securities regulation, including the prevention and management of systemic risk (risks to the stability of the financial system), fall under federal jurisdiction. The SCC also recognized that a cooperative approach to Canadian securities regulation, whereby Parliament and the provincial legislatures exercised their respective powers harmoniously, might be constitutional.In response to the Court's guidance, the Federal Government and the governments of five provinces and one territory entered into the Agreement, setting out the framework for the Cooperative System.Summary of the Cooperative SystemThe Agreement includes four principal components:Uniform Provincial Legislation - each participating province will enact a statute that mirrors a Model Provincial Act (the Capital Markets Act) which addresses the day-to-day aspects of securities trade.Complementary Federal Legislation - Parliament will enact a federal statute (the Capital Markets Stability Act) which legislates on issues of national concern such as criminal matters and systemic risk.National Regulator - the Federal Government and the participating provinces will delegate certain regulatory powers to a single Capital Markets Regulatory Authority (CMRA) responsible for administering the entire cooperative scheme.Council of Ministers - the creation of a supervisory council, made up of the Ministers responsible for securities regulation in each participating province and the federal Minister of Finance. The Council of Ministers would oversee the CMRA and has authority to approve proposed amendments and regulations.The Supreme Court of Canada's DecisionThe SCC overturned the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal, finding that both the Cooperative System and the draft federal statute are constitutional.With respect to the first question, as set out above, the Court held that the terms of the Agreement do not, and cannot, fetter the provincial legislatures' primary law-making authority. In particular, It found that nothing in the proposed system empowers the Council of Ministers to unilaterally amend the provinces securities legislation. Further, no element of the Cooperative System imposes any legal limits on the participating provinces legislative authority to enact, amend, and repeal their respective securities laws as they see fit. The principle of parliamentary sovereignty precludes the executive signatories of the participating provinces from binding their respective legislatures. Therefore, the decision whether to opt-in or out of the Cooperative System and to adopt the required implementing legislative changes, remains under the authority of the particular provincial legislatures.For these reasons, the SCC found no constitutional impediment to the implementation of the Cooperative System in accordance with the terms set out in the Agreement. While the Court took a legalistic approach in its decision it did note that, from a practical perspective, participation in the Cooperative System by the partaking provinces requires a significant commitment. It requires them to effectively dissolve their existing securities commissions, to merge the administration of those commissions into the national structure and that, once this is done, it would undoubtedly be impractical for those jurisdictions to extricate themselves from a national system.With respect to the second question, it was determined that the Capital Markets Stability Act falls within Parliament's jurisdiction over general trade and commerce pursuant to the Constitution Act, 1867. The Court found that the pith and substance of the Capital Markets Stability Act was to control systemic risks having the potential to create material adverse effects on the Canadian economy. Nothing in the draft federal statute purports to regulate, on an exclusive basis, all aspects of securities trading in Canada. Specifically, it does not contain provisions that go to the day-to-day regulation of securities trading. The Court went on to note that while provinces have the capacity to legislate in respect of systemic risk in their own capital markets, they cannot effectively address national concerns which transcend their own respective concerns. The Capital Markets Stability Act, with its carefully tailored scope, constitutes a response to this provincial incapacity, and addresses risk that \"slips through the cracks\" and poses a threat to the Canadian economy as a whole.What this Decision Means for Alberta Moving ForwardWhile the SCC's decision represents a victory for supporters of a national securities regime, if and when the Cooperative System will be implemented remains unclear. While the proposed system is constitutional, the Court's decision does not address the various practical and political complexities that may arise. For instance, since the Cooperative System was first suggested, the provincial governments of Ontario and British Columbia, representing the largest capital markets of the participating provinces, have changed. Ontario has indicated that it is still committed to launching the Cooperative System, however, time will tell whether the current leaders of the participating provinces are prepared to expend the necessary political capital required to implement it.Alberta was firmly opposed to the Cooperative System, specifically to the idea of a national regulator, when it was first proposed, and continues to be. After the SCC released its decision, Joe Ceci, the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance for Alberta, issued a statement affirming the Government of Alberta's view that the uniqueness of Alberta's capital market requires a local regulator that understands its complexities.The Government of Alberta's announcement that it remains opposed to a national regulator suggests that the province has no intention of joining the proposed Cooperative System. As a result, it is unlikely that there will be substantial changes to the regulation of securities in Alberta - at least in the short term.There are a number of practical reasons why a national securities regulator may not be in Alberta's best interest.Alberta benefits from having a local securities commission that allows the province to have a strong voice in the establishment of harmonized securities regulation across Canada. The CSA has operated effectively to promote the harmonization of rules and policies across the country, through negotiation between the various provincial regulatory authorities. This has resulted in policies and guidelines that take into account the divergent and unique interests of the various provinces and the distinct nature of their capital markets.Arguably, the Cooperative System would limit the ability of individual jurisdictions (like Alberta) to ensure that there is regulatory balance that meets their specific local needs. With a national securities regulator, there is concern that securities regulation will ultimately become Ontario centric (since Toronto is the national financial center), which could negatively affect Alberta's ability to influence change in a manner that protects the unique characteristics of its local market.The impact of establishing a national regulator will depend on the nature of the cooperation between the national regulatory authority and the non-participating provinces. Presumably, it is in the interest of all parties to continue to ensure that there is a harmonized and efficient regulatory scheme across the country. Achieving this will require a system similar to the current CSA, with cooperation between the non-participating provincial regulatory authorities and the national regulator. This raises the question of whether the creation of a national regulatory authority can accomplish anything meaningful if not all provinces are participating.How these and other administrative issues are addressed will continue to be of considerable interest to those involved in the Alberta capital market.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

JUDE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL","content":"Jan 25, 2019( EclipseMagazine.com: http://www.eclipsemagazine.com Delivered by Newstex)  On Wednesday, January 23, Hollywood stars joined thousands of VIPs in LA's thriving arts community at the LA Convention Center for the 24th Annual LA Art Show Opening Night Gala, benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for the 5th year in a row. Boasting record breaking attendance, all proceeds from the sale of Patron and Vanguard tickets and 15 percent of sales of Friend tickets went directly to the charity. All attendees of the Opening Night Premiere party supported the lifesaving mission of St. Jude: Finding cures. Saving children. Kate Beckinsale drew a crowd as the evening's host, meeting with St. Jude patient families and delivering an address about the organization's mission to the VIP area. Gavin Rossdale, an avid collector and this year's Art Ambassador, reminded the audience that art can save lives. They were joined by previous host Emma Roberts, and stars such as Jessica Szohr, Peyton List, Cameron Monaghan, Joe Manganiello, Lance Bass, Amy Smart, Odette Annable, Brandon Boyd, Brigitte Nielsen, Evan Williams Bailee Madison, Kevin Zegers, Perrey Reeves, Amber Stevens West, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Naomi Grossman, Davi Santos, Barry Sloane, Brittney Palmer, Ian Bohen, Denim Richards, Celeste Thorson and many more. Art stars Tristan Eaton, Camille Rose Garcia, Jorge R. Gutierrez, Gregory Siff, Dave Pressler, Brandi Milne, Dosshaus, Mikael B, and hundreds more were in attendance.VIPs enjoyed cuisine by James Beard Award-Nominated Chef Jeffrey Nimer of Haute Chefs LA, and Executive Chef Nick Shipp of The Upper West, desserts from celebrated local chefs Valerie Gordon and Shannon Swindle, NESPRESSO, Cavit Prosecco and delicious hors d'oeuvres from over 20 select LA restaurants. In addition to food, beverages, live music and art, gala attendees were given special sneak peek of the LA Art Show's 200,000 sq. ft. of programming, featuring over 100 galleries from 18 countries. RISK's bisected cop car, Scott Hove's cake wall, Pip ...p's candy installation, Dosshaus's Littletopia archway and the mirrored light sculptures by Anthony James at Melissa Morgan Fine Art proved to be huge hits with the gala-goers. They also got to see the first of many performances by Dorian Wood and Sarah Trouche, among others. The LA Art Show opens to the public at 11am on Thursday, January 24 and runs until Sunday, January 27, closing at 5pm. Day One of the Fair will feature live performances by Cha, Yun Sook and Sarah Trouche, and panels by Janice Lyle, Michael Stern and Timothy Yarger Fine Art. At 5:30pm under the Littletopia archway, Camille Rose Garcia will be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by Brandi Milne. The LA Art Show will be held at the Los Angeles Convention Center from January 23 - 27, 2019. As the city (and west coast's) largest art fair, and one of the most diversely programmed in the world, the LA Art Show features a comprehensive lineup of exhibitors not only in contemporary and modern art, but also classical and other specialized art scenes that often command their own dedicated shows.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:46Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721570&p=4s5&v=1&x=YP68GrbHpHJ2jSg25J-ioA","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"525","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

Pricing 360 ndash; December 2018","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With an evolving transfer pricing law in India, certain issues like Advertisement, Marketing and Promotion (AMP), continue to trigger arguments amongst the taxpayers and revenue authorities, which give way to unending debates. In this issue, we cover the latest judgment, which has deleted the AMP adjustment and has disregarded AMP as an international transaction. While the debates continue, the industry still awaits the verdict of the Apex court to put the AMP issue to rest, and expects guidance on the approach to be followed for the arm's length price determination.Apart from this, the other rulings are targeted on the issue of guarantee fee transaction and intragroup/management fee transaction. In this edition, under the India Updates, we bring you the notification released by CBDT, (apex Tax body in India) providing due date for undertaking Country by Country Report compliance (CbCR). This notification is applicable in cases where there has been no arrangement for automatic exchange of information between India and the country of the ultimate parent or where there has been a systematic failure in exchange of information.The Global Developments section covers the key transfer pricing related developments in Japan, wherein the draft reforms have been issued for the interest deduction limitation and hard-to-value intangibles. The edition also covers updates with respect to Saudi Arabia and Argentina transfer pricing documentation requirement.A. JUDICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTSPepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd1 - AMP expenditure, not an international transaction, absence of any agreement, understanding or arrangementFacts of the case The taxpayer is a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc. USA and is mainly engaged in the business of manufacturing soft drink/juice-based concentrates, and other agro-based food products.The taxpayer had obtained a nontransferrable, royalty-free license from its Parent company in US, (Associated Enterprise (AE)) for the technology to manufacture the concentrate and to use and exploit the brands owned by the said AE in the regions designated to the taxpayer.Approach of the tax authorities The tax authorities, while accepting the related party transactions to be at arm's length, made a significant adjustment towards the AMP expenditure of the taxpayer, citing the observation that the expenses must have been incurred at the behest of the AE for promoting the brand owned by the AE.The Trademark License agreement between the taxpayer and its AE empowered the latter to approve and review the advertisement proposed to be telecasted in India. Further the AE was also recovering some part of the AMP expenditure (pertaining to the worldwide sponsorship rights) from the taxpayer. Thus the tax authorities alleged that there was an \"action in concert\" between the taxpayer, and it's AE, which constituted an international transaction as per section 92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act).The Ruling of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) The Tribunal pronounced its ruling in favour of the taxpayer by placing reliance on various rulings and deleted the adjustment proposed by the lower tax authorities.Whether AMP expense is 'international transaction' The Tribunal held that if one of the parties (taxpayer in this case) by its own volition is incurring any expenditure for its business purpose, and there is no binding obligation on the other party (AE), either by way of an oral or written arrangement, then it cannot be characterized as an 'international transaction' within the scope and definition of Section 92B of the Act.Whether huge AMP spends by taxpayer benefit the AE The tribunal held that the taxpayer thoroughly enjoys all the rewards for AMP functions and the returns associated with the commercial exploitation of the brand. Therefore, under Functions, Assets and Risk analysis also, no such benefit from the AMP expenditure having any bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets has accrued to the AE or any kind of benefit has arisen to the AE.Considering that the brand developed in India will only help in the promotion of sales in India and not in the jurisdiction of the other AEs, the Tribunal held that AMP spends by the taxpayer did not benefit the AE.Whether the use of Bright Line Test (BLT)/Profit Split Method (PSM) and any other method for benchmarking AMP expense is appropriate The Tribunal placed reliance on the High court ruling in the case of Maruti Suzuki and rejected the use of BLT, both for determining the existence of an international transaction and also for benchmarking the transaction.Furthermore, the Tribunal also rejected the use of Profit Split Method and other methods for benchmarking the transaction of AMP.SKP CommentsAs the matter relating to TP adjustments on account of AMP expenses, is pending adjudication before the Supreme Court, the tax tribunals in India (including this case) are placing heavy reliance on two landmark judgments (i.e., Sony Ericsson and Maruti Suzuki) in the context of Marketing intangible. The fate of these two landmark judgments and perhaps many others, will be determined once the apex court in India provides its judgment.The Tribunal in this case has given due weightage to the factual aspects and data submitted by the taxpayer. Accordingly, it is critical to have adequate data/facts/figures, such as sales growth, Function, Asset and Risk profile of the taxpayer and the AE, etc., as proof to substantiate the benefits received by the taxpayer.Furthermore, analysis of the intercompany agreement is critical while studying AMP functions performed, if any, by the Indian subsidiary of a multinational group. Therefore, it is advisable to review the terms of the inter-co agreement as well, which captures the true substance of the business arrangement and intensity of functions to be carried out.Glenmark Pharmaceuticals3 - SC dismisses Revenue's appeal, confirms deletion of guarantee fee TP-adjustmentFacts of the case The taxpayer, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products and related R#38;D activities.During Assessment Year (AY) 2008-09, the taxpayer extended guarantee in respect of bank loan and L/C facility obtained by its (Associated Enterprises (AEs), viz. Glenmark Holding SA Switzerland and Glenmark Generic SA Argentina and charged guarantee fee @ 0.53% in respect of guarantee for a bank loan and @1.47% in respect of guarantee for L/ C facility.Approach of the tax authorities Tax authorities adopted a guarantee fee rate of 3% on the basis of the guarantee commission rates charged by the banks and proposed an adjustment of INR 115.1 million.The Ruling of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)However, in appeal, the Tax Tribunal rejected the tax authorities' use of naked quotes of bank guarantee rates for benchmarking corporate guarantee. The Tribunal explained that in Bank Guarantee, the customer could recover the default amount from bank and the bank, in turn, could recover the same from the customer. As against this, in corporate guarantee, failure to honor the guarantee may attract corporate laws, but from a risk perspective, it is not comparable to a bank guarantee. Thus, the Tribunal relying on various rulings on guarantee commission, including Everest Kanto Cylinders Ltd4, held that guarantee commission rates charged by the taxpayer were reasonable, and the bank guarantee rates cannot be adopted.The judgment of the High Court Thereafter, the High Court also confirmed the Tribunal's view as no distinction in facts and/or law had been brought on record warranting a different view from what was held in the case of Everest Kento Cylinders Ltd.The judgment of the Supreme CourtIn further appeal before the Supreme Court (SC), SC rejected reopening of the appeal, stating that the issue has been rightly decided by the High Court in favor of the taxpayer. SKP CommentsThe issue of corporate guarantee is one of the frequent contentious issues in the battleground of TP litigation.During TP audits, tax authorities have often used external comparable guarantee rates provided by banks as the comparable uncontrolled price for benchmarking the guarantee fees transaction. However, at the Tribunal level, bank guarantee, commonly referred as 'naked guarantee,' has been differentiated from that of 'corporate guarantees.' It has been held that 'naked quotes' need to be adjusted for factors such as risks, functions, term, period, etc., and cannot be directly compared to corporate guarantee transactions.Jabil Circuit India Private Limiteds15- accepts CPAcertificate as Valid Evidence for Cost Allocation based on OECD-GuidelinesFacts of the case A taxpayer, a subsidiary of Jabil (Mauritius) Holding Limited, Mauritius, was engaged in assembling printed circuit boards for set-top boxes. The associated enterprise (AE) provided support function (including IT Support services and non-IT services) to the overall group and then allocated the same based on pre-determined allocation keys. The taxpayer had received, from its AE, corporate support services and business development support services and at the same time had provided certain services to its AEs.The approach of Tax Authorities The tax authorities did not accept the cost allocation keys and Arm's Length Price (ALP) of the intra-group services transaction stating that the taxpayer failed to produce evidence to substantiate that these services were provided by the AE or any benefit was received. Furthermore, the tax authorities also stated that the supporting documents furnished by the taxpayer (intercompany agreement, CPA certificate, etc.) were very generic and the allocation keys used were vague and hardly of any evidentiary value. Thus, the tax authorities substituted the allocation keys used by the taxpayer with an estimation of total 1500 working hours at INR 8,500 per hour.The Ruling of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)The Tribunal set aside the orders of lower authorities and deleted the TP adjustment by relying on Mumbai High Court ruling in the case of M/s Maersk Global Services Centre. The ruling of the ITAT is provided below:The rejection of the allocation keys adopted by the taxpayer and its substitution with an ad hoc estimation provided by the tax authorities of total 1500 man hours at INR 8,500, was considered whimsical and bizarre.The supporting evidence submitted by the taxpayer was reasonable and cogent, which was totally disregarded by the authorities below.Based upon the Maersk ruling and the revenue's plea for remand was rejected, since the evidence that was relied upon, was made available by the taxpayer at the time of assessment before the lower level tax authorities.Taking cognizance of OECD Guidelines on intra-group services, the Tribunal stated that the use of allocation keys for intragroup services is not alien to international tax jurisprudence, and the allocation of concerned group expenses to different accounting units was a duly accepted accounting procedure, and the allocation keys, as well as methodology, are as per the guidance provided by OECD.In regard to the lower authorities' rejection of the CPA certificate (for failure of submitting the underlying documents based on which such certificate was issued), the Tribunal referring to Rule 10D of the Income Tax Rules opined that the action of the authorities in rejecting the CPA certificate, which is quite specific and duly authenticated, is not sustainable and should be accepted as an evidenceThe Tribunal also highlighted that the estimation and allocation methodology adopted by the taxpayer was duly accepted by the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) as the revenue for AY 2013-14.SKP CommentsIn the above case, the Tribunal accepted foreign accountant's certificate (CPA) as valid evidence to justify the cost allocation key for intragroup services. Hence, in addition to the need benefit test documents,, one can also place reliance on such evidence (like CPA certificate) as valid documentation u/s 92D of the act.B. REGULATORY UPDATESCBDT Prescribes Timelines for furnishing CbCR for Entities in Specified CircumstancesIndia had adopted the provisions of Country by Country Reporting (CbCR) in keeping with the OECD's BEPS Action Plan 13, and then introduced the section 286 in its local law. As per these regulations, the constituent entities of a Multinational group were required to comply with the provisions and furnish the CbCR. This CbCR was required to be filed in the jurisdiction of the ultimate parent/any other entity designated to be the alternate reporting entity of the group.Section 286 also refers to the compliance requirement for cases wherein the country of the ultimate parent had not signed any Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the exchange of CbCR with India (e.g., US-based groups). In such cases, where no alternate reporting entity has been designated by the group, the onus of filing CbCR is shifted to the Indian subsidiaries of the group.Thus, in certain cases where the obligation to furnish the CbCR rested on the Indian entity, due to certain conditions being met, there was ambiguity in terms of the deadlines for filing of such CbCR by Indian entities, as the same was not yet prescribed for FY 16-17 as well as FY 17-18 compliance. Recently, on 18 December 2018, the CBDT issued its notification wherein the timelines for furnishing the CbCR report were provided in the below scenarios:As per the notification, the CbCR due date for the group, following a reporting accounting year that ended on December 2017, was 31 December 2018. Furthermore, the CbCR filings for the year ended December 2016 had already lapsed by the time this notification was issued.In view of the above limitation and considering that the taxpayer would need to face hardship in complying within a short notice, the CBDT issued a yet another notification dated 26 December 2018, extending the prescribed deadlines for filing CbCR, as a one-time measure.This extension of deadline till 31 March 2019, comes as a big relief to all such taxpayers, which were obligated to undertake CbCR filing in India.To view the full article click here[1]Footnotes1.

When she talks to me about them, it�s only to complain. All she has is negative things to say about them. When she talks to them, she criticizes them. If you were a fly on the wall when she spoke to her boyfriends you�d find yourself asking, �Do these people even like each other?� The tones used are certainly not loving or respectful. When I gently pointed out to this person how she speaks to her partners, she�d come back with justifications. She�d just repeat to me all the reasons they deserved that tone. And, for the record, her reasoning was often correct. But she was missing the bigger picture. The question isn�t why are you yelling at your partner but rather why do you constantly date men who make you want to yell?

Desi Salt Alternatives to Replace Unhealthy Table Salt","content":"Jan 25, 2019( DESIblitz: http://www.desiblitz.com Delivered by Newstex)  'Salt is also a big issue and, over time, a high-salt diet is associated with high blood pressure.' The human body needs salt, and it gives the food the final tasty note. Even though table salt (sodium chloride) is the most common on the market, there are healthier and tastier salt alternatives. DESIblitz discovers five desi salts that are aesthetically appealing, and healthier than table salt. Salt is a magnificent mineral that the human body requires for healthy functioning. All salts consist of chemical element sodium, which is necessary for blood circulation and regulation of body water. Sodium also helps the organism to absorb nutrients. Furthermore, table salt has iodine, which is a crucial nutrient for thyroid functioning.However, table salt[1] goes through heavy processing and contains additives to prevent clumping. Throughout the processing, it loses essential minerals that natural Kala Namak and Sendha Namak contain. If taken in excess, table salt can be very health damaging.Why is Salt Bad for You Too much salt increases sodium in one's blood. The high amount of sodium can be especially dangerous for diabetics. 'Salt is also a big issue and, over time, a high-salt diet is associated with high blood pressure.' Dr Sandy Gupta[2], a consultant cardiologist for NHS says in the interview. Other health problems caused by excessive amounts of it in our nutrition are thyroid problems, paralysis and impotence. Due to their body shape, the South Asian population is more prone to the risk of heart diseases. Fat around the middle is common in South Asian body type. That extra fat increases the insulin production to stabilise blood sugarand creates risk for type 2 diabetes. They are diagnosed with diabetes type 2 twice more often than Caucasians. Traditional South Asian diet can potentially increase the risk if consumed too much. There is a lot of fried food high in salt, such as samosas. Salt is added to most of the processed foods.In our daily diet, salt can be found around 75 % in processed foods. Therefore, you should keep an eye on the amount of bread, cereals and prepared meals that you consume. FSA[3] (Food Standards Agency) found that 20% of salt intake is added at home during cooking or seasoning meals.NHS[4] suggests to look at food labels and buy food lower in salts.The recommended daily intake for adults is maximally 6 g of salt or 2.4 g of sodium per day. That equals one teaspoon. You can even download a Food Scanner app[5] and calculate the amount of sugar, salt and saturated fat in your food. You merely have to scan the barcode. To be healthier, you should limit the salt intake while cooking and seasoning prepared meals. DESIblitz offers you salt alternatives that will enrich the specific tastes of South Asian cuisine and will boost your health.Indian Black Salt (Kala Namak) Other names for Kala Namak areSulemani Namak, Bit Lobon and Kala Noon.It is rock salt made out of South Asiancondiment, containing mostly sodium chloride. The sulphur elements in the Kala Namak are responsible for its distinctive smell, and savoury taste. Iron sulphide and other minerals give it a magical dark violet shade. The black crystals are ground into pink powder during production. Black Salt has a sulphurous taste similar to hard-boiled egg yolks.It is best to use with yoghurts, chutneys and meals such as Pani Puri and cool drinks like jaleera. It is advisable to store the black salt in wooden or ceramic containers and grind it with a ceramic grinder. Otherwise, it reacts with metalthat changes its chemical structure. European Journal of Pharmaceutical Research[6] reports that consuming black salt daily can significantly improve constipation without irritating your stomach. In table 2 with ion percentages, Kala Namak has 3% of iron. Iron is an essential mineral in the blood for life energy and better athletic performance.Because of its iron content, people use black salt for anemia.'Ordinary table salt had a calcium level of 218 g/g. Iron levels ranged from 2 to 500 g/g with the highest level of 518 g/g in the Kala Namak Black Mineral Salt' according to the Analysis of Gourmet Salts for the Presence of Heavy Metals[7]. In Ayurvedic medicine, Kala Namak is used as a cooling spice and a digestive medicine to relieve gasses and heartburn. Furthermore, black salt is used in many anti-obesity products such as Lavana tail. Switching to black salt can help you with weightless. However, it still has to be consumed in small amounts. Unlike many cosmetical products, black salt doesn't contain artificial chemicals, so it helps with skin problems. Adding some black salt to warm water in a bath can help with athlete's foot, cracked or swollen feet. Due to many natural minerals, black salt can be used as a natural medicine for hair growth and split ends. Give yourself a luxurious treatment and heal your hair dandruff with a mixture of tomato juice and black salt. Rub it into your hair daily. Furthermore, rub a bit of black salt into your face while taking off your makeup to remove dry skin cells. Most importantly, black salt is beneficial for diabetics because it doesn't increase sugar levels in the blood. Therefore, the need for insulin intake is lower. However, taking black salt in excess is not advised for anyone, especially for people with high blood pressure. Its sodium content of 98 % is not much different from the white salt, which is 100 %.Amazon Wholefood Earth Fine Kala Namak Himalayan Black Salt 500 g ~ 3.16 Pink Salt (Himalayan Rock Salt - Sendha Namak) Pink salt[8] is a rock salt from Punjab, Pakistan near Himalaya. It comes from Khewra Salt Mine, one of the biggest and oldest salt mines in the world. It contains 98 % of sodium chloride, just like Kala Namak. Central mineral sodium in Pink Salt is essential to the human body in moderate amounts. It balances out fluids in the body and prevents dehydration and low blood pressure. Moreover, it helps with contracting and relaxing muscles and sends impulses to the nervous system.If you consume a pinch of salt with water in the morning it can boost your energy.However, Sendha Namak is considered more natural than table salt. That is because it is not chemically refined with additives such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate like table salt. Another difference of pink salt[9]is that it's harvested manually, and therefore it keeps minerals that white salt doesn't have. Sendha Namak contains minerals like potassium, calcium and magnesium, so it has healing properties and helps with sore muscles. The minerals make it pink and healthier than white table salt. 'It contains 84 out of the 92 trace elements required by the body including potassium, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, copper and so on. It's a superior salt, according to Ayurveda,' saysDr Ashutosh Gautam[10]. Using it as a bath salt can help with muscle fibre and improve skin ailments. Mineral potassium in pink salt[11] balances out the sodium absorption. Therefore, sodium from Himalayan pink salt doesn't raise blood pressure. The minerals also contribute to the taste of pink salt, which is saltier than in white salt. That can be helpful in reducing the amount of salt intake in your organism. Consequently, it takes less amount of salt to achieve a salty taste. Take this into account while seasoning food. However, coarsely ground pink salt contains less sodium than finely ground powder, so consider that as well while cooking. It can be used for cooking sauces and marinades and can be added to already prepared food.Large blocks of pink salt are sometimes used as a cooking surface. Pink salt can be used for beautiful lava lamps and candleholders. Furthermore, people go into pink salt caves to improve their respiratory systems.Sainsbury's Jamie Oliver Pink Salt Grinder 90 g ~ 3.00 Whole Foods OnlineHimalayan Rose Pink Salt Coarse 1 kg ~ 4.97 Waitrose ...rtnersBart Himalayan Pink Salt 90 g ~  3.99 Celery Salt Celery salt[12] is a mixture of ground celery or lovage seeds and table or sea salt. Sea salt can intensify and bring out citrus and herbal taste of celery. Celery is an ancient medicinal herb used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine. Beneficial nutrients contained in celery seeds are minerals manganese, iron and calcium, and essential oils limonene and pinene. Two teaspoons of celery salt can satisfy the daily need of your organism for manganese.Celery salt also contains a 20 % of a daily iron requirement and 5 % calcium.Iron prevents anaemia, while calcium aids the bone health and functioning of muscle and nerve system. Manganese is good for metabolism and blood coagulation. Limonene functions as an antioxidant, while pinene has anti-cancer and antibiotic features. Celery seeds also help in treating high cholesterol and in lowering the high blood pressure. Celery contains phthalides that lower blood pressure. They are organic chemical compounds that soften the tissues of the artery walls and encourage the blood flow. Sodium in celery salt can cause water retention. Celery seeds help to balance the effects of sodium and help clear the organism of water. Celery seeds also function as a diuretic that boosts urine production. The celery salt can be a great addition to meat. It can be mixed in a marinade combined with garlic powder, ginger, paprika and black pepper. It also intensifies the taste of vegetable juices.Tesco Celery Salt 75 g ~ 0.85 Sainsbury's Celery Salt 78 g ~ 1.00 Just Ingredients Online Celery Salt 100 g ~ 2.19 Garlic Salt Garlic salt[13] is made with one part of ground garlic powder and three parts of table salt.

It is organic and made out of natural stone. As one of the rarest salts in the world, it is a real privilege to use it. Persian Blue Salt originates from Iran. It is also produced in Pakistan at Sian Enterprises[15]. They are one of the largest producers of Himalayan Crystal Salt. Persian Blue Salt is formed out of fossilisation of crystals formed in Precambrian seas 100 millionyears ago. The magically blue salt was formed in the process of evaporation of inland seas and ponds. It is extracted from the mountains of the Semnan province in Northern Iran and the Ergourz mountain range. Sylvinite, a potassium mineral found only in the healthiest salts makes this salt sapphire blue. However, the colour is mainly the effect of the compressed molecular structure that refracts the light creating the blue reflection. Persian Blue Salt is high in potassium, iron, calcium and magnesium.Potassium helps regulate water balance, acidity levels, and blood pressure in the body.The taste is sweet and slightly lemony. Therefore, Persian blue salt can reduce the acidity of the food. It is mainly used on finished dishes to enhance the flavour and as decoration. It is very dry so it can be ground. It enriches the taste of fish, tomato sauce and salad and other dishes. Persian Blue Salt is also great on fresh fruits and vegetables.Sous Chef Online Blue Salt 100 g ~  5.95 Amazon Persian Blue Salt 200 g ~  5.69There are benefits of table salt, but it can be health damaging and dangerous for diabetics if consumed excessively.

is object oriented programming?","content":"Jan 01, 2018( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Object-oriented programming (OOP) has become one of the building blocks of programming, replacing - or working in tandem with - the concept of procedural programming. Whereas the more traditional idea of procedural programming puts action and logic at the centre, OOP utilises objects and data to produce outcomes. On the simplest level, OOP focuses on the objects a programmer wants to change rather than the actions needed to make that change. This makes it easier for programmers to run a code analysis and also, because many of the objects are reusable for other projects, the time it takes to develop an application, for example, can be shortened significantly. The majority of modern programming languages such as C++, Object Pascal, Java, Python use a combination of object-oriented programming, as well as procedural programming where required, meaning OOP has become a very important evolution in the world of development. OOP concepts and ideasBecause objects can be given attributes and behaviours, and be organised into classes, it makes this method of development much more efficient for collaborative working. For example, projects can be grouped together based on matching classes and attributes, with developers focusing on the relationships between objects rather than the objects themselves. Additionally, objects can be granted the same properties and behaviours of parent objects, meaning less needs to be done to these superclasses because they're inherently the same, just with a different relationship. Parent and child classes are also known as subclasses or derived classes and this inheritance of classes allows OOP code to be used over and over again, achieving what is known asruntime polymorphism. Polymorphism refers to the ability for tasks to be achieved in multiple ways, so OOP can choose the specific called function at runtime, depending on the context of the current scenario. Within the polymorphism bracket, there are two types of function:overriding and overloading. Overriding (also known as run-time polymorphism) is used when two objects have the same method name and parameters (i.e. method signature), but one method is in the parent class and the other is in the child class. Overloading (compile-time polymorphism) happens when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but diverse parameters. Abstraction is where a programmer can conceal everything except the relevant data about an object in order to decrease complexity and increase efficiency. In other words, representing features without including background details or explanations. Encapsulation is a concept where data and methods that work on that data are bundled together in one unit. It's used to conceal values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorised direct access to them. Abstraction and encapsulation may sound similar, but the two differ in that abstraction hides unwanted details while giving out the most essential details, while encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit.Examples of object-oriented programming languagesThere are many different languages that use object-oriented programming. Among them are Java (which was developed in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, now Oracle), Python (created in 1991 and emphasises code readability), C++ (which has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features and is an extension of the C programming language), and Objective-C (which adds Smalltalk-style messaging to C and was the main programming language for OSX and iOS).","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:44Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721403&p=4s5&v=1&x=9N89VeUlgCnhXx2kbmNnnw","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"606","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved","duplicateGroupId":"38350721403","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{"itemId":"5V8K-6F81-F03R-N1FP-00000-00"},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"name":"COMPUTER PROGRAMMING","score":"95"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING","score":"92"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING","score":"90"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES & TOOLS","score":"90"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"C++ PROGRAMMING","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"CHILDREN","score":"72"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"Sun Microsystems"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Sun Microsystems"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"Newstex"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Newstex"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"}]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.51068354","entities":[{"type":"Product","value":"OSX","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Product","value":"iOS","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true}]},"print":{"supplement":"","publicationEdition":"IT Pro"},"author":{"name":"rmillman","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"LexisNexis Licensed"}],"source":{"id":"111249","name":"IT Pro","homeUrl":"http://www.itpro.co.uk/","category":"Trade","editorialRank":"3","aggregatorId":"9","aggregatorName":"Newstex Publications","location":{"country":"United Kingdom","countryCode":"GB","region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"5.70","pageAuthority":"57.00","domainAuthority":"71.00","externalLinks":"893282","links":"970702"}},"feed":{"id":"518213988","name":"IT Pro","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"LexisNexis Licensed","idFromPublisher":"3003","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"false","autoTopics":[]}}},{"sequenceId":"915940731586","id":"38350721404","language":"Telugu","languageCode":"te","title":"???????

'The trilogue agreement with Council approved today is a significant victory for the EPP Group. We managed to keep a balance between the interests of internet users while at the same time protecting the European film industry. Cultural diversity and creativity in Europe will be protected,' said Angelika Niebler MEP, the group's spokeswoman on the dossier. The agreement includes mechanisms to facilitate the clearance of copyright and related rights of radio and TV content for cross-border digital broadcast and retransmissions. The new rules will provide a fairer and wider distribution of news and current affairs programmes and promote access to information. 'I welcome the fact that the Parliament reached an acceptable deal with the Member States. We agreed that broadcasters could make their news, current affairs programmes and also their own fully-financed productions available for the online community and hence accessible across the whole European Union,' said Pavel Svoboda MEP, chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee who is responsible for the report. 'It was the EPP Group that listened to the fears of the European film-makers. I am glad that we found a common approach with the Member States by modernizing the copyright rules and adapting them to the internet realities and at the same time safeguarding the creative industry

Moving Average in Focus for Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP): Level Touches 1.9313889","content":"As soon as an individual decides what they want out of their investments, they can start formulating the best way to accomplish those goals. The time horizon for each investor may be different. Fluctuations in the financial markets can have a big effect on shorter-term investments. Investors that need a certain amount of money in a shorter amount of time may be looking to develop a stock market strategy with a bit less risk involved. On the other end of the spectrum, a younger investor with a longer time horizon might be able to search for stocks with a higher potential for growth that may involve much more risk. The volatility of today�s markets can test the nerves of any investor. Understanding volatility and market fluctuations can help the investor gauge their risk tolerance in the markets. \n \nThere are multiple moving average indicators that traders may rely on when conducting stock research. One of the most popular is the Simple Moving Average. The SMA is unweighted, meaning that each period in the set of data is weighted equally. Looking at some SMA levels for Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) , we can see that the 10 day is 1.96, the 20 day is 1.907, and the 30 day is 1.8527566. Tracking some other time periods, we note that the 50 day SMA is 1.728104 , the 100 day is 1.862995 , and the 200 day SMA is currently 1.9447485. \n \nExpanding the technical focus for Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP), we see that the Keltner Channels 20 day upper band is 1.9690512, and the 20 day lower band is1.829359. The Keltner Channels indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. \n \nTracking the Hull Moving Average, we note that the current level is 1.9313889. The Hull Moving Average was introduced by Alan Hull. Swing traders often use this indicator in combination with other signals in order to help identify possible entry and exit spots. \n \nTracking some one month stock pivot points, we note that the Classic Pivot is 1.9333333, the Classic resistance 1 is 2.1066666, and the Classic support 1 is presently 1.8366667. The Fibonacci one month pivot is 1.9333333 while the \nFibonacci support 1 pivot is 1.8301933, and the Fibonacci support 2 is 1.7664733. Looking at one month Woodie pivot, we note the level at 1.9475. The Woodie support 1 pivot is 1.865, and the Woodie resistance 1 pivot is 2.135. \n \nMany traders will look to optimize stock trades by using various technical indicators. The Ichimoku Cloud indicator is highly flexible and is commonly used in conjunction with the RSI to help confirm momentum and overall trends. Let�s focus on a few different Ichimoku readings: \n \nIchimoku Cloud Base Line: 1.8551 \nIchimoku Cloud Conversion Line: 1.96025 \nIchimoku Lead 1: 1.55375 \nIchimoku Lead 2: 1.77 \n \nTraders focusing on technical analysis may be interested in following the Awesome Oscillator level. Currently, the reading is 0.13283971. Typically, when the Awesome Oscillator moves above the zero line, this would indicate that the short term momentum is rising quicker than the long term momentum. A cross below the zero line would indicate that short term momentum is dropping faster than the long term momentum. \n \nTraders following shares of Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) may have noted that the stock most recently closed at 1.95. Going back a full-year, the stock has seen a change of -18.410042 over that stretch. Taking the focus in to more recent action, shares have seen a move of 2.631579 over the last week. Over the prior month, the stock has moved 30. Over the past three months, the stock has moved -3.4653466. \n \nWhen getting into the markets, most investors realize that riskier stocks may have an increased potential for higher returns. If investors decide to take a chance on some of these stocks, they may want to employ some standard techniques to help manage that risk. This may involve creating a diversified stock portfolio. Mixing up the portfolio with stocks from different sectors, market caps, and growth potential, may be the right move. In general, the goal is to maximize returns in accordance with the individual�s specific risk profile. It should be obvious that no matter how well rounded the portfolio is, there are always risks in the equity markets. Having a sound plan before investing can help ease the burden of knowing that markets can sometimes do crazy things without any rhyme or reason.

for a production run","content":"I'm going to make a short list and then offer some explanations and reasons after it.\n\n\n\nReview your roleKnow your call timePartner with your peersAsk questions before opening night\n\n\n\n\nFor all of your rehearsal time, you have been inundated with cues and lines as well as (hopefully) supporting actors who help you when you struggle, both on stage and off. But when it comes time to run the show? Especially on those days when you are no longer rehearsing and you're working by yourself alone at home (or at work, wherever). It comes down to you to maintain your skills and capabilities to ensure each show of a production remains the exact same as opening weekend. Audiences deserve that (and more) from you and you deserve that (and more) from yourself.\n\n\n\n\nLet's say the preceding rules description doesn't apply to you; you do that on your own, without reminding, and are as prepared as you can be to deliver the best performance of the run each and every single night. It doesn't matter if you aren't on time, miss call time, or are late to a production. A show that starts late is a bad experience for the audience, your peers, and yourself. You can't put on a good show if you aren't there to put it on, right?\n\n\n\n\nI have a caveat while explaining my fourth rule.\nDon't be afraid to question ANYTHING that you are unsure of, questioning, or concerned about. The best time to do that is before opening. After every one has rehearsed and is presently ready for their big moment.. it can be unfair to question things and potentially lead to changes. However, if you are unsure of things, don't let yourself remain uncomfortable or over challenged. Tell someone on the staff and get it addressed, in some way or form. The crew is there to enhance and improve your experience within the show; don't lose an opportunity to still have fun.\n\n\n\n\nThis list is not all inclusive, there's so much more that came to mind while I was writing this, but these were the items I deemed most important. Maybe I'll mention one more thing: the importance of warming up. The lights can only do so much to keep you warm, you have to be physically and mentally prepared to go on each night.

Highlights are below per Wrestling Inc[1]: On the WWE Universal Championship: 'I don't think it matters if Brock Lesnar held the Universal title or not, and I don't think anybody cares about the Universal title. It's meaningless. Who cares? I think people care about Brock. I think he is such a badass, and such a larger than life character, and so unbeatable that the world is waiting to see who and if anybody will come along and knock him from his throne. But I don't think there would be any more or any less interest in any of those matchups if the belt was not a part of it.' On why the nWo Wolfpac was created: 'At the core of it I would say 80% of the reason was because nWo was losing steam. If it would've been hot we would've been able to come out with nWo jockstraps and people would tailgate out in the parking lot and wear them like hatsbut I think overall it was just because the concept was no longer new. By this time it was two, two-and-a-half years old. You know in the beginning when we flooded the market with shirts, it was so fresh and nobody had ever seen anything like it before. It was cool.' On why he won't debate Vince Russo: 'I have zero respect for him. I think he's a fraud. I think he's just a creep. I just don't like him. He's lied to me and showed me his colors so many different times. I get people all the time saying, oh you should debate him. F*** I've debated him in front of Dixie Carter, TNA's attorney. I made him cry like a little child. Because I revealed him for what he really is. And I've done it in front of a whole bunch of people by the way. So I have no desire to give him an audience and try to let him get himself over with his nonsense by debating him.'

The Mets are still looking to add a veteran starting pitcher, but prefer to ink him to a minor-league deal, according to New York sources. Much like Derek Holland, who I've heard also interested the Mets, Perez obviously had a better option. Holland inked a one-year, $7 million deal earlier this month. As a result, the Mets continue to eyeJosh Tomlinand other veteran arms (such as Bartolo Colon) considered desperate enough to take a non-guaranteed contract and invite to spring training. It's worth noting that people say Tomlin enjoyed his time in Cleveland working with Mickey Callaway, who is now managing the Mets and clearly has a strong reputation among the league's pitchers. 2) It's a weak market for Lagares In the event the Mets need to deal Juan Lagares, they can expect to bring back only an up-and-down reliever due to be a free agent, earning similar money and with a similar risk. The Mets aren't getting prospects and they sure aren't getting salary relief. In other words, at this point, the only way I see the Mets dealing Lagares is if they acquire an outfielder better and/or more reliable than he is and it becomes smart to move him for pitching depth. 3) Harper and Machado, Machado and Harper The Phillies have enough money to sign two premium free agents. However, they're more likely to sign Bryce Harper or Manny Machado and one or two pitchers, such as Dallas Keuchel and/or Craig Kimbrel. This is partly because of the Phillies, but mostly because Machado and Harper know that to maximize their deals it is best for them to be with different teams. The way it stands, the White Sox, Phillies and Yankees are considered the most likely teams to end up signing Machado. However, I've talked to some people that actually think the Pirates and Marlins have interest. Meanwhile, the Phillies, Nationals and Astros, and maybe the Blue Jays, are considered the most likely teams to sign Harper. The Cubs and Dodgers want him too, but just can't fit him into their current budget. Harper started this winter hoping to land in Chicago, New York or Los Angeles, which is why more and more people think he could choose to remain a free agent until at least late February. 4) All eyes on Philly Along those lines, the upper half of the free agent market is stopped, waiting for the Phillies to make a move. The common sense is they much prefer to sign Machado. And, reports of their love affair with Harper is by design to keep him intrigued, while also creating leverage in talks with Machado. That said, if Machado balks and takes less to sign with the White Sox or someone else, the Phillies will happily take Harper. But, all things equal, like most people, I believe they would rather end up with Manny. The buzz around A.J. Pollock, Keuchel, Kimbrel, etc., will become more intense the minute the ink starts to dry on Machado's contract. 5) Are the Braves done spending? In an effort to add an outfielder, the Braves had reportedly been negotiating with Pollock, Nick Markakis and other options in the free agent and trade market. In the end, they chose Markakis, who played for them in 2018. By spending roughly $10-12 million less next season on Markakis instead of signing Pollock, the Braves now have enough money to plug their remaining holes in pitching staff with more prominent talent. In other words, it wouldn't surprise me to see them get on all remaining top pitchers, specifically Gio Gonzalez and a reunion with Kimbrel. 6) So, what happens with Pollock? I still think there's a legit chance he ends up signing with the Mets. There are several teams interested, but very few are down for giving him the four- to five-year deal he hoped to get at the start of the offseason. At this point, especially now that the Braves are out of the mix and the Cubs and Dodgers are short on funds, it's very, very difficult to see him signing more than a three-year deal, especially if he's hellbent on being paid an annual salary of at least $20 million. As a result, insiders believe he's more likely to accept a short-term deal paying $15-17 million or taking a one year, roughly $20 million pillow contract that would let him retry being a free agent next winter. 7) You're not getting Nolan Arenado -- at least not yet Teams keep asking about the Rockies about Arenado. However, the popular belief is that even if a team wants him, like Yankees, because the Rockies expect to win in 2019, they can't be serious about trading their best, most popular player, who wants to remain in Colorado. Instead, people say the Rockies are clearly feeling out offers to gauge the player's value as they continue talking with him about a long-term contract. Worst case, by talking with teams now, they've laid the groundwork for a possible trade this summer. As a free agent, expectation is Arenado will see offers of at least $250 million over eight years. 8) Why is Castellanos still on the Tigers? The Mets are among the teams to show interest in Tigers OF-3B Nick Castellanos. However, in the end, like the rest of the National League, the Mets weren't eager to overpay for a guy that is clearly a DH, especially since the Tigers have been asking teams to pick up all of the player's salary. 9) If Mets want to trade Wheeler, look to Gray... The industry seems to feel the Yankees and Reds made a fair deal when swapping Sonny Gray (and a minor league pitcher) for what net out to be a top 10 prospect from the Mariners. This is what Brodie Van Wagenen could expect to get for Zack Wheeler, it seems, according to deal makers around the game. Wheeler is much better than Gray, but neither is an ace and (as of last week) both had one year left on their current contract. 10) I wouldn't rule out a strike... During the next Collective Bargaining Agreement, the MLBPA is expected to push hard for major structural changes to how players negotiate and get paid.

Doch der Sender ging am Ende nicht darauf ein.\n\nM�nchen - Florian Silber�eisen �bernimmt das Kommando auf dem Traumschiff! Der Schlagerstar wird neuer Kapit�n an Bord des ZDF-Klassikers. Der Sender best�tigte am Freitag: �Wir freuen uns sehr, Florian Silbereisen gewinnen zu k�nnen. Er ist einer der interessantesten und beliebtesten Entertainer der j�ngeren Generation und setzt die von Wolfgang Rademann begr�ndete Tradition fort, Fiktion und Entertainment auf dem Schiff zusammenzuf�hren.� Rademann hatte das Traumschiff 1981 erfunden und bis zu seinem Tod vor drei Jahren produziert.\n\nIm Februar sollen nun die Dreharbeiten mit �Silbereisen beginnen. F�r ihn sei die Rolle eine �Herzensangelegenheit�, so der 37-J�hrige. An Weihnachten und an Neujahr k�nnen die Zuschauer ihn als Kapit�n Max Prager bestaunen.\n\nTraumschiff-Kapit�n: Hardy Kr�ger jr. w�re Hehns Wunsch-Nachfolger\n\nDie Rolle war frei geworden, nachdem sich �Sascha Hehn � im Streit um die Qualit�t der Drehb�cher und Filme! � von Bord verabschiedet hatte. Und Hehn hatte auch einen Wunschkandidaten f�r seine Nachfolge, wie er im Gespr�ch mit der tz verr�t: Hardy Kr�ger jr.! �Ich hatte ihn vorgeschlagen�, sagte Hehn am Rande der Rodenstock-Brillen-�Modenschau. �Der w�re super!� Tats�chlich war Kr�ger im Gespr�ch f�r die Rolle. Er ist ein gestandener Schauspieler, war schon in mehreren Episoden auf dem Traumschiff zu Gast und w�re kein schlechter erster Mann an Bord gewesen.\n\n�So ein Kapit�n sollte eine Portion Mut mitbringen, sich mit Drehb�chern auseinandersetzen und diese versuchen, einigerma�en in die Spur zu bringen�, erkl�rte Hehn am Donnerstagabend und f�gte � hatte er eine Ahnung?! � schmunzelnd hinzu: �Aber vielleicht f�llt dem ZDF ja noch etwas Verr�ckteres ein, vielleicht Florian �Silbereisen� Dann wird�s nat�rlich �ne ganz andere Nummer.� Genau so ist es jetzt gekommen.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:57:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:45Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:57:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721472&p=4s5&v=1&x=UI2onuTOGUjki32_Xa1Q0w","outboundUrls":["https://www.fehmarn24.de/kino-tv/florian-silbereisen-wird-zdf-traumschiff-kapitaen-sascha-hehn-wollte-anderen-zr-11486262.html?cmp=defrss#","https://www.fehmarn24.de/stars/florian-silbereisen-wird-traumschiff-kapitaen-zdf-bestaetigt-meldung-zr-11037978.html","https://www.fehmarn24.de/stars/thomas-seitel-taucht-nach-geruecht-auf-und-ist-kaum-wiederzuerkennen-helene-fischer-freund-in-muenchen-zr-11483749.html"],"wordCount":"292","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721472","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.fehmarn24.de/bilder/2019/01/25/11486262/1361951952-florian-silbereisen-X1nNt3muMef.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.fehmarn24.de/bilder/2019/01/25/11486262/1361951952-florian-silbereisen-X1nNt3muM01.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["IND"],"name":"�FFENTLICH-RECHTLICHES FERNSEHEN","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"PROMINENTE","score":"71"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"PRAG, TSCHECHISCHE REPUBLIK; TSCHECHISCHE REPUBLIK","score":"54"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.1","entities":[{"type":"Company","value":"ZDF","mentions":"4","score":"1.2","evidence":"5","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Wolfgang Rademann","mentions":"2","score":"-1.3","evidence":"4","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Hehn","mentions":"8","score":"0.0999999","evidence":"6","confident":true}]},"author":{"name":"Stefanie Thyssen","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"18089","name":"Fehmarn24.de","homeUrl":"https://www.fehmarn24.de","category":"Local","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"4.70","pageAuthority":"47.00","domainAuthority":"44.00","externalLinks":"28035","links":"32594"}},"feed":{"id":"169659073","name":"Fehmarn24.de","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940732531","id":"38350721473","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"The Good Place season 3 episode 12 review: Pandemonium","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Den of Geek: http://www.denofgeek.com Delivered by Newstex)  Alec Bojalad[1] Jan 25, 2019 The Good Place Season 3 finale reaches deep into its sitcom history book to tell a little story about love.

One of my earliest TV watching memories (yes, you have these when you're a TV nerd turned TV critic) is asking my mom why the couples on all the sitcoms I watched were constantly breaking up. I don't know what show I was referring to necessarily but bear in mind that I was around 7 or 8 years old during the peak Ross and RachelFriendsera. My mom calmly explained to me that the writers on these shows needed conflict to tell a story. And there was no conflict to be found in the story of a happy couple. Instead of taking this lesson to heart, abandoning the artifice of television, and I don't know, learning math or some shit, I continued to watch these sitcoms and reveled in all that tried to buck this 'will they or won't they' trend. Scrubswas probably the first show I remember succeeding. J.D. and Elliot had a will they or won't they energy for three full seasons before they decided the answer was 'won't they.' Of course they got together in the show's final season but it still deserves credit for featuring five full seasons in full-on 'won't they' mode. And Turk met his actual soul mate in the show's pilot and would stay with her forever. Now on the modern television landscape, shows aren't afraid to get couples together and keep them together. Shows likeYou're the Worst,Catastrophe, and evenThis Is Usrealise that while 'will they or won't they' is easy drama, 'how will we continue on together forever?' is therealdrama. It's harder to articulate and pull off but it's more worthwhile. It's more real. There is value to be had in breaking the shackles of sitcom writing. Having said that, there is also value to be had in succumbing to them for the right reasons. The Good Placecreator Michael Schur is a keen student of TV history. Ted Danson is on this show for a reason. The Good Place season two finale put Danson back behind the bar for heaven's sakes! Schur, like my dear ol' mum, knows that the sitcom is a science as much of an art. Press button; create pathos. Here he and his writers have dusted off the 'separate a couple mid-series' gambit. They're no different from the sitcom writers of yesteryears. They need conflict to tell a story. This time around, however, the conflict they've chosen is the eternal damnation of the entire human race. PandemoniumcontinuesThe Good Place's tradition of absolutely killer season finales. Each season closer has come along with a certain twist, paradigm shift, or revelation. This one, however, is the most straightforward, or as 'straightforward' as this show can get. As expected, Eleanor has taken over Michael's job as architect and one-woman Good Place introduction committee to the new arrivals in the experiment. Also as expected: she's an absolute natural. 'It's like I became such a good person I forgot that I'm a world-class liar,' Eleanor tells Chidi after welcoming John into the neighbourhood. She's not wrong. If I can't be welcomed into heaven by Ted Danson then Kristen Bell is absolutely my second choice. All in all, the humans feel pretty good about how the experiment is coming along. The neighbourhood looks great as always. This week's Megan Amram (who wrote this finale alongside Jen Statsky) food pun is the beer stand 'Foot Lager.' John seems to be getting settled in well and not noticing that his peers are all Janet babies. He even learns that Drake and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were the most random celebrity couple on Earth. Then the other shoeor 'foot lager' drops because it always must. Another thing that mama taught this lad about television is that as long as the episode guide doesn't say 'Series Finale,' there is no room for a happy ending. Tahani uncovers that John is an asshole. This isn't a surprise because the Bad Place was allowed to accept humans for this experiment. The problem is that John is a very specific kind of asshole. John wrote for a blog called 'The Gossip Toilet' - a site known for pioneering the countdown clock to the Olsen twins 18th birthday and for making life living hell for Tahani. While Tahani is known for bouts of extreme solipsism, this time her paranoia is correct: The Bad Place didn't select the worst people, they selected the people that would be worst for Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason. Tahani's fears are confirmed when the next human arrives and it's.CHIDI'S EX-GIRLFRIEND SIMONE! This is Pandemonium's 'this is the Bad Place' twist moment. It doesn't have the universe up-ending implications of the show's previous twists but my stomach literally dropped all the same. Simone was such a great character and Kirby Howell-Baptiste such a perfect fit for the show that it always felt strange that we just had to leave her back on Earth as Team Cockroach went on to bigger, more celestial adventures. Still, I never imagined the show would bring her back and certainly not in this fashion. The Judge rules that The Bad Place's gambit falls within the rules but Michael will be allowed to wipe Simone's memory. Chidi, however, knows that that's not a solution. Chidi is a very awkward individual and he knows it. It's not a crime to be awkward and in fact it's probably one of the things that attracted Eleanor to him. In this situation, however, that awkwardness could have brutal implications. 'If I'm awkward around my ex, everyone gets tortured forever,' Chidi tells Michael and Eleanor. There is only one solution here, only one way to preserve the integrity of the experiment and save humanity's collective soul. Michael has to erase Chidi's memory. He must erase everything from Australia onward. He has to erase Eleanor. In practice Chidi and Eleanor's relationship hasn't always been the most compelling onscreen part ofThe Good Place. Bell and William Jackson Harper have good chemistry but we've just seen them interact mostly on a friend level save for their time in Reboot 119 and the last few episodes. Plus, the other onscreen romance in the show is between a break-dancing Jacksonville doofus and an omniscient being of the universe - so that will take presence. Chidi and Eleanor's relationship has always been important for what it represents though. They represent the insatiable human need for love, itself. Remember, Eleanor and Chidi have spent over 800 timelines not in love and just two in love. That just makes it feel all the more special though. The Good Placeis about finding the answer to the long sought after question: what makes a good person? What even is 'good?' But just like all the other great works of art, The Good Place already knows what the real answer is. It's love, stupid. Chidi and Eleanor's relationship symbolises that even if you experience love only two out of 800-plus lifetimes, those two times make this whole 'existence' thing a success. That's why it's so powerful for The Good Placeseason three finale to go back to this relationship-severing sitcom trope. It's using one of television's laziest tropes for a profound examination of what really matters. After a lovely video presentation from Michael, Chidi's memory is erased and Eleanor in her new role as architect is struggling get composed for what comes next. She summons Janet. 'Hello Janet. Can you just like tell me the answer? The answer to everything,' she commands. There is no answer obviously, and Janet says as much. The point of the universe isn't to find the answer but to merely experience it. In all this Pandemonium, Eleanor found Chidi, which is simply impossible. It's impossible in the grand scale of the universe, this Milton-ian pit of hell, to find anything worthwhile. But Eleanor did it. Then she did it again. And if I know anything about television, she'll do it once more. Once the characters break up in sitcoms, they eventually get back together in the end. When its series wrap time and there are loose ends to be tied, you tie them. Perfect little student of TV history that it is,The Good Placewill find a way to get Chidi and Eleanor back together. When they do it, however, it won't be because the show has to, it's because Eleanor and Chidi have to. That's what people do - they charge through the pandemonium to find that which seems impossible to find over and over again.

The \"QFC Stay Rules\" require Covered Entities to include contractual stay language in certain of their qualified financial contracts (\"QFCs\") to mitigate the risk of destabilizing closeouts of Covered Entities' QFCs, which is a perceived impediment to the orderly resolution of a GSIB.Recently, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (\"SIFMA\") published a revised version of their standard master selected dealer agreement, which includes the new QFC language. They also published an explanatory memorandum addressing the application of the QFC Stay Rules to underwriting and similar agreements. The revised master selected dealer agreement is available at https://goo.gl/6aMZZ3[1] and the memorandum is available at https://goo.gl/ujH5ZJ[2].Covered Entities have begun to include the new QFC language in terms agreements to their distribution agreements. There are exclusions to the new requirement, which are covered in the SIFMA memorandum and may be available to a Covered Entity.Visit us at mayerbrown.com[3]Mayer Brown is a global legal services provider comprising legal practices that are separate entities (the \"Mayer Brown Practices\").

The issue focuses primarily on determining how much it costs to hire teachers and other school employees in various parts of the state. A price-level index, which is calculated to try to represent those costs, is part of a broader formula that lawmakers approve each year to distribute money to districts. But the index has long faced scrutiny, with questions about whether it benefits some districts at the expense of others. Lawmakers included $100,000 in this year's budget to hire a consulting firm to conduct a study, and House PreK-12 Appropriations Chairman Chris Latvala, a Clearwater Republican, said the House will examine the issue. 'I think it's something the House is certainly looking at and will be studying,' Latvala said after his panel heard a presentation Thursday on a report by the consulting firm, The Balmoral Group[1]. Latvala said that anytime lawmakers change the funding formula it will affect school districts but that the House doesn't want to pick 'winners and losers.' https://piff.net/how-aob-abuse-happens/The broader school-funding formula, known as the Florida Education Finance Program[2], takes into account numerous factors in distributing money and totals about $21.1 billion this year. Those factors range from enrollment numbers to student transportation. But debates about the costs of hiring school employees have flared over the years and were particularly controversial in 2003 and 2004 as then-Senate President Jim King, a Jacksonville Republican, spurred changes in the calculations. The changes benefited some school districts and caused financial hits for other districts. A key part of the changes involved factoring in the presence of 'amenities,' such as proximity to beaches, in looking at where people want to live and how much they are willing to accept as wages. Some beachfront school districts, such as Volusia County, have long argued that they have been penalized by factoring amenities into the equation. Material presented to the House panel Thursday by The Balmoral Group said the 'working hypothesis' of the price-level index is that the 'variables chosen in the formula are accurate predictors of wages across all counties.' But the consulting firm also offered an 'alternative' hypothesis that raised questions about factoring in amenities. 'The approach assumes all teachers have the same preferences for the same levels and types of amenities,' the alternative hypothesis said. 'While each year's predicted index model may be unbiased from a statistical standpoint, it is unclear that the process does not consistently bias certain counties above or below the average year on year.'https://beckerlawyers.com/With the annual Legislative Session starting March 5, it remains too early to know whether lawmakers will make changes. Also, Senate Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, a Fleming Island Republican, pointed Thursday to a move by lawmakers in the current year's budget to help narrow funding gaps among districts. That move involved providing about $56.8 million in additional money for districts that in the prior year received per-student funding that was below the state average � a move known in education budget circles as a 'compression' adjustment. 'On the Senate side, we're always interested in making sure that educational dollars are apportioned in an appropriate and fair way across the state. I thought that there were some inequities in the system before last year, and I think compression funding went a long way towards addressing those inequities in a positive manner,' Bradley said.

United States Is at It Again: Compiling an Enemies List","content":"Jan 25, 2019( The Duran: http://theduran.com Delivered by Newstex)  Authored by Philip Giraldi via The Strategic Culture Foundation:[1] Many American still long for the good old days when men were still manly and President George W. Bush was able to announce that there was a 'new sheriff in town' pledged to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth. 'You're either with us or against us,' he growled and he backed up his warning of lethal retribution with an enemies list that he called the 'axis of evil.' The axis of evil identified in those days in the2002 State of the Union Address[2]consisted of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Iraq, which had not yet been invaded and conquered by the American war machine, was number one on the list, with Saddam allegedly brandishing weapons of mass destruction deliverable by the feared transatlantic gliders that could easily strike the United States. Bush explained that 'Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to developanthrax and nerve gasand nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.' North Korea meanwhile was described as 'A regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens'whileIran'aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while anunelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.' The phrase 'axis of evil' proved so enticing that Undersecretary of State John Bolton used it two months laterin a speech[3]entitled 'Beyond the Axis of Evil.' He included three more countries - Cuba, Libya and Syria because they were 'state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursueweapons of mass destruction(WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.' The nice thing about an Axis of Evil List is that you can make up the criteria as you go along so you can always add more evildoers. Iraq was removed from the playing field in March 2003 while Libya had to wait for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be dealt with, but North Korea, Cuba, Syria and Iran are still around. Nevertheless, the idea of an enemies list continues to intrigue policy makers since it would be impossible to maintain the crippling burden of the military industrial complex without a simple expression that would convey to the public that there were bad actors out there waiting to pounce but for the magnificent efforts being made by Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon to defend freedom. The Administration of President Donald Trump, not to be outdone by its predecessors, has recently come up with two enemies lists. The first one was coined by the irrepressible John Bolton, who is now National Security Adviser. He has come up with the 'troika of tyranny' to describe Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua,where he sees[4]'the dangers of poisonous ideologies without control, and the dangers of domination and suppression I am here to convey a clear message from the President of the United States about our policy towards these three regimes. Under this administration, we will no longer appease the dictators and despots near our coasts in this hemisphere. The troika of tyranny in this hemisphere � Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua � has finally found its rival.' Bolton also demonstrated that he hasa light touch[5], adding 'These tyrants fancy themselves strongmen and revolutionaries, icons and luminaries. In reality, they are clownish, pitiful figures more akin to Larry, Curly, and Moe. The three stooges of socialism are true believers, but they worship a false God.' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has apparently also been looking at Venezuela and not liking what he is seeing. On his recent road trip to the Middle Easthe told reporters[6]that 'It is time to begin the orderly transition to a new government [in Caracas].' He declared that 'The Maduro regime is illegitimate and the United States will work diligently to restore a real democracy to that country. We are very hopeful we can be a force for good to allow the region to come together to deliver that.' 'Force for good' is another key soundbite used by Pompeo. In his Cairo speech on January 10th, he described the United States as a 'force for good' in the entire Middle East. Bolton might have thought 'troika of tyranny' was a hands down winner, but he was actually upstaged by the dour Vice President Mike Pencewho declared[7]to a gathering of US Ambassadors that 'Beyond our global competitors, the United States faces a 'wolf pack of rogue states.' No shared ideology or objective unites our competitors and adversaries except this one: They seek to overturn the international order that the United States has upheld for more than half a century.' The states Pence identified were North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Of the five, only North Korea can even plausibly be considered as a possible threat to the United States. As wolves are actually very social animals the metaphor provided by Pence does not hold together very well. But Pence, Bolton and Pompeo are all talking about the same thing, which is the continued existence of some governments that are reluctant to fall in line with Washington's demands. They have to be banished from polite discourse by declaring them 'rogue' or 'tyrannical' or 'evil.' Other nations with far worse human rights records - to include Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Israel and Egypt - are given a pass as long as they stay aligned with the US on policy. So useful 'lists' are all about what Washington wants the world to believe about itself and its adversaries. Put competitors on a list and condemn them to eternal denigration whenever their names come up. And, as Pence observes, it is all done to prevent the overturning of the 'international order.' However, his is a curious conceit as it is the United States and some of its allies, through their repeated and illegal interventions in foreign countries, that have established something like international disorder. Who is really doing what to whom is pretty much dependent on which side of the fence one is standing on.

Esports Announces Profit-Sharing Initiative, Event Sponsorship","content":"Jan 25, 2019( 411mania.com: http://411mania.com Delivered by Newstex)  PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is looking to up its game in the eSports world with a series of financial initiatives to support teams. eSports Insider reports[1] that PUBG Corp. is launching new initiatives that will include profit-sharing on team and league-branded in-game items, directly supporting operating costs for teams and event sponsorship. PUBG Corp. will help with the costs of the teams operating in National PUBG League (NPL) in North America and PUBG Europe League (PEL). This will include travel and housing expenses. In addition, in-game iterms for the leagues will be added during the season's Phase 2 in April, with 25% of the sales going to the teams. Also included will be sponsored competitions hosted by PUBG partners that will include teams from all six regional leagues, with their own in-game items that again will give 25% of sales to participating squads. PUBG Corp. will also match partner prize pools, effectively doubling the amount of win money. The move comes as an attempt to bolster PUBG's eSports scene, which has flagged in recent months. Several prominent organizations have left, and PUBG issued multiple-year bans to over a dozen players that qualified for NPL and PEL. Richard Kwon, CMO of PUBG Corp. said in a statement, 'We are nothing without our teams and players, so it's critical that we develop these programs to support our competitive scene and help teams build their brands. In addition to building a popular esport that caters to our PUBG fanbase for years to come, we want to create a financially viable environment for players to sustain themselves and profit from their hard work.' The NPL is set to kick off its first season on February 1st.

Jennifer","content":"On today's episode of Natural Home with Jennifer , I'm sharing some new natural finds in four different categories.\nHand Sanitizers\nBirdie and Minnie Hand Sanitizers by Olika are wonderful little inventions. Here are some of their attributes:\nVALUE - With 350+ sprays or 175 uses, Birdie replaces 10+ bottles of gel based alternatives.\nHYDRATING - Formulation is proven to improve skin hydration for up to 24 hours.\nBETTER-FOR-YOU INGREDIENTS - Formula contains 7 simple, natural ingredients that you can recognize and understand: Alcohol, water, glycerin, aloe vera and the essential oils of lemon, spearmint and bergamot.\nNO NASTY CHEMICALS: Vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free and void of any harsh chemicals or artificial fragrances.\nDUAL FUNCTIONALITY - Birdie contains a sanitizing spray plus 10 dry wipes. Simply spray liquid on to wipe to capture dirt and grime on hands.\nHIGH TECH - Birdie contains a twist locking mechanism to prevent accidental sprays on-the-go. Our bird needs to be fully unlocked in order to spray liquid.\nThe Minnie has 500+ sprays or 250 uses, Minnie replaces 15+ bottles of gel based alternatives.\nThey are also TSA friendly, so you can take them on your flight. Olika sent me these to review back in December and I've been using them ever since. They are very handy and make a great natural alternative to traditional chemical-laden hand sanitizers. Shampoo + Conditioner\nThe Acure Argan Oil + Pumpkin Shampoo and Conditioner is a beautifully hydrating duo with a delightful scent. (Seriously, this smells amazing). I purchased mine on Grove Collaborative but you can also find the set on Amazon. Vegan, gluten and cruelty free\nParaben, sulfate, silicone, sodium chloride, phthalate and synthetic fragrance free\nColor safe, 100 percent biodegradable\nI find these to be very moisturizing. They get my hair clean and I like their natural properties. Eczema Therapy Cream\nI requested the Kamedis Dermatology Eczema Therapy Cream to try as I have suffered from a particularly bad case of hand eczema of late. (Watch today's video to hear the whole story.) I find this cream to be very soothing and does help my hands when I suffer from a flare-up. Here are some of the botanicals found in this natural cream:\nChinese Rhubarb: a strong anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial botanical\nGreat Burnet\nTree of Heaven\nBaikal Skullcap\nCnidium Fruit\nLicorice\nHere is more on Kamedis Dermatology from their website:\nKamedis skin formulations are derived from natural botanicals used in traditional Chinese medicine, botanicals that have been renowned for their therapeutic properties for hundreds if not thousands of years. Ours are conscientiously sourced and meticulously purified. Our manufacturing process employs the highest quality standards, including assessment of physical and chemical properties and microbiological testing.\n**Please ask the opinion of your healthcare professional before using any new product to treat your eczema condition. e-cloths - clean with just water\nI love my e-cloths and was excited to test out the electronics cloth and glassware polishing cloth They both performed beautifully. I was especially impressed with how the electronics cloth polished my laptop. To use, try it on your electronics dry first. If you have any stubborn streaks, dampen one corner of the cloth with water and wipe, then go over the same spot with a dry part of the towel. The glass polishing cloth has a rough texture that is perfect for polishing your glasses. A great thing to do before a dinner party. I hope you enjoyed the items reviewed on today's Natural Home with Jennifer. If you have any requests for this series, please let me know. Have a wonderful weekend and I'll see you on Monday for an all new video. *NEW* The Daily Connoisseur merchandise, including tee shirts now available\nVisit my Author Website\nShop my favorite things\nFacebook facebook.com/JenniferLScottAuthor\nTwitter @JL_Scott\nInstagram @dailyconnoisseur\nTake my eCourse on the Ten-Item Wardrobe\nTake my eCourse Chic Financial Principles for Debt-Free Living\nSign up for my Seasonal Author Newsletter\nFTC: This is not a sponsored post.

(:AXSM): HMA Reading of 8.2382965 Sparks Interest in Investors","content":"Some investors will scour the markets looking for cheap, quality stocks. These stocks can be attractive for investors looking to find a bargain that could turn into a big winner. Investors may be cautious when searching for these types of stocks. Often times, a stock will see a huge jump and then everyone will hop on the bandwagon to buy without checking into the fundamentals. Sometimes this strategy may work out, but in many cases, the stock has already made the run and become too expensive to add to the portfolio. Conducting diligent research and constantly adding to the individual�s overall market education level may help the investor sift through the sea of stocks and find those names that are really worth getting into. \n \nMany traders will look to optimize stock trades by using various technical indicators. The Ichimoku Cloud indicator is highly flexible and is commonly used in conjunction with the RSI to help confirm momentum and overall trends. Let�s focus on a few different Ichimoku readings on shares of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (:AXSM) : \n \nIchimoku Cloud Base Line: 7.46 \nIchimoku Cloud Conversion Line: 8.4 \nIchimoku Lead 1: 2.5025 \nIchimoku Lead 2: 2.78 \n \nTraders following shares of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (:AXSM) may have noted that the stock most recently closed at 8.34. Going back a full-year, the stock has seen a change of 164.7619 over that stretch. Taking the focus in to more recent action, shares have seen a move of 3.4739454 over the last week. Over the prior month, the stock has moved 279.0909. Over the past three months, the stock has moved 111.675125. \n \nThere are multiple moving average indicators that traders may rely on when conducting stock research. One of the most popular is the Simple Moving Average. The SMA is unweighted, meaning that each period in the set of data is weighted equally. Looking at some SMA levels, we can see that the 10 day is 8.2635, the 20 day is 7.94525, and the 30 day is 7.2240434. Tracking some other time periods, we note that the 50 day SMA is 5.28145 , the 100 day is 4.235848 , and the 200 day SMA is currently 3.878189. \n \nTracking some one month stock pivot points, we note that the Classic Pivot is 7.9199667, the Classic resistance 1 is 8.829933, and the Classic support 1 is presently 7.2500334. The Fibonacci one month pivot is 7.9199667 while the Fibonacci support 1 pivot is 7.316445, and the Fibonacci support 2 is 6.9435883. Looking at one month Woodie pivot, we note the level at 7.899975. The Woodie support 1 pivot is 7.21005, and the Woodie resistance 1 pivot is 8.78995. \n \nTraders focusing on technical analysis may be interested in following the Awesome Oscillator level. Currently, the reading is 1.6566147. Typically, when the Awesome Oscillator moves above the zero line, this would indicate that the short term momentum is rising quicker than the long term momentum. A cross below the zero line would indicate that short term momentum is dropping faster than the long term momentum. \n \nTracking the Hull Moving Average, we note that the current level is 8.2382965. The Hull Moving Average was introduced by Alan Hull. Swing traders often use this indicator in combination with other signals in order to help identify possible entry and exit spots. \n \nWhen it comes to investing in the equity market, discipline can play a major role in achieving ones goals. A few bad moves can send the investor�s confidence spiraling. Acting purely on emotion can lead to impulsive decisions that may cause the losses to pile up. Creating a solid plan and following through with the plan can help investors stay on track and focus on the proper details. Markets are constantly going up and down and the investing ride can sometimes be a bumpy one. Being able to see the big picture and focus on the important data can help keep the investor tuned in to the right channel. Investors who expect to jump into the market and immediately start raking in the profits may find out fairly quickly that trading without a plan can be a recipe for defeat.  \n \nExpanding the technical focus for Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (:AXSM) , we see that the Keltner Channels 20 day upper band is 8.281738, and the 20 day lower band is7.0996614. The Keltner Channels indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:59:35Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:59:35Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721710&p=4s5&v=1&x=cnEXhW_2Ciy81KUDXFF62A","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"682","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350338453","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"EQUITY RESEARCH","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"TRENDS","score":"74"}],"companies":[{"name":"Axsome Therapeutics Inc","symbol":"19X","exchange":"STU","titleCount":1,"contentCount":3,"primary":true},{"name":"Axsome Therapeutics Inc","symbol":"19X","exchange":"FRA","titleCount":1,"contentCount":3,"primary":true},{"name":"Axsome Therapeutics Inc","symbol":"AXSM","exchange":"NAS","titleCount":1,"contentCount":3,"primary":true},{"name":"Axsome Therapeutics Inc","symbol":"19X","exchange":"DUS","titleCount":1,"contentCount":3,"primary":true},{"name":"Axsome Therapeutics Inc","symbol":"19X","exchange":"BER","titleCount":1,"contentCount":3,"primary":true},{"name":"Hop-On Inc","symbol":"HPNN","exchange":"PINX","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":false}],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"Robotics Society of India"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"RSI"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.4"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"Axsome Therapeutics inc"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Axsome Therapeutics, Inc."},{"name":"instances","value":"4"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"SM&A"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"SMA"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.89"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Woodie"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Woodie"},{"name":"instances","value":"2"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.791"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"Hma Associates Inc"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"HMA"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.416"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Alan Hull"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Alan Hull"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"}]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.21721952","entities":[{"type":"Product","value":"Classic Pivot","mentions":"1","score":"-0.6","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Alan Hull","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Bollinger Bands","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true}]},"author":{"name":"Alfredo Boyd","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"220675","name":"NorthfieldReview.com","homeUrl":"https://northfieldreview.com","category":"Trade","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"2.10","pageAuthority":"21.00","domainAuthority":"23.00","externalLinks":"1364","links":"19003"}},"feed":{"id":"647627813","name":"NorthfieldReview.com","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940734026","id":"38350721711","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"Formaldehyde Controversy Raises Concerns For Retailers Over EPA's Future Review And Regulation Of Chemicals And Associated Litigation Risk","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Companies in the retail industry may soon be grappling with new regulations and increased litigation risk involving formaldehyde, a common chemical found in consumer products like wood glue, foam insulation, paints, cosmetics and fragrances. In 2018, amid controversy over the chemical industry's alleged pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withhold an updated human health risk assessment, which will reportedly link exposure to formaldehyde to leukemia and other cancers, consumer groups successfully compelled EPA to begin early enforcement of its new rule governing formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products. The tug-ofwar between consumer groups and industry groups on formaldehyde over the last year has potential consequences for companies impacted not only by the formaldehyde regulations, but who may also be impacted by regulations on the horizon as EPA moves forward with its new risk evaluations on 10 \"high priority\" and widely used chemicals.EPA's Integrated Risk Information System Program (IRIS) first classified formaldehyde as a \"probable human carcinogen\" in 1991, linking exposure to the chemical as potentially causing nasal cancer. In 2010, the agency released a new draft risk assessment, proposing to revise formaldehyde's classification to \"carcinogenic to humans\" and linking formaldehyde exposure to leukemia for the first time. The scientific data and methodology underlying the revised risk assessment were met with sharp criticism. In response, EPA requested that the National Research Council (NRC), a committee of the National Academies of Sciences (NAS), perform a peer review of the draft risk assessment. The NRC reported in 2011 that EPA's conclusions regarding leukemia and related hematopoietic cancers suffered from serious \"data gaps\" and were not supported by any clear scientific framework. The NRC also issued specific recommendations for the revision of not only the draft risk assessment itself, but also the overall review process for future assessments. Congress then directed EPA to implement the NRC's recommendations, and EPA began the process of re-reviewing its risk assessment to take into account the NRC's recommendations.IRIS completed the update to its formaldehyde risk assessment in late 2017, but to date EPA officials have declined to review the study or approve its release. The updated risk assessment reportedly still links exposure to formaldehyde and leukemia, despite the NRC's criticism of that conclusion in 2011. Industry groups have met with EPA and have publicly expressed concerns that the updated risk assessment will be merely a \"restructuring\" of the original draft and will still suffer from the same scientific and methodological defects previously identified by the NRC. Consumer groups and legislators have accused EPA of bowing to industry pressure to withhold the updated assessment and have continued to call for its release. Meanwhile, EPA has suggested that the agency is re-evaluating some of the science underlying the assessment and is currently facing a lawsuit filed by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) alleging that EPA failed to respond to the group's public records request.As the debate over the release of the risk assessment heated up earlier this year, EPA was also forced to defend its decision to delay the effective date of a Final Rule implementing the Formaldehyde Emission Standards for Composite Wood Products Act of 2010 (Formaldehyde Final Rule), which amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to add TSCA Title VI. The Formaldehyde Final Rule sets forth emissions limits for formaldehyde in composite wood products (which are often used in furniture, flooring and construction) and imposes a number of testing and record-keeping requirements on companies in the supply chain. Although the Formaldehyde Final Rule was originally scheduled to take effect in December 2017, EPA announced a year-long delay in September 2017 in order to allow companies more time to prepare for compliance.Consumer groups objected to EPA's decision, citing alleged immediate threats to public health from exposure to formaldehyde. After filing suit against EPA in California federal court, they reached an agreement with EPA that the agency would begin enforcement of the Formaldehyde Final Rule as of June 1, 2018mdash;more than six months earlier than companies had planned. The new June 1 compliance date posed serious compliance challenges and came at great cost to furniture manufacturers, distributors and retailers, who were forced to act quickly to design and implement procedures that were not expected to be required until months later.For companies in the retail industry, the controversy over formaldehyde has led to greater public scrutiny of the chemical and its alleged health effects, which often translates into increased litigation risk. Plaintiff's lawyers searching for the \"next wave\" of toxic tort and product liability litigation may look to get out ahead of EPA's formaldehyde risk assessment, filing lawsuits early and banking on the report's anticipated conclusions regarding leukemia. For their part, consumer groups may also put pressure on companies by conducting their own independent studies of popular consumer products and publicizing results that show traces of formaldehyde in those products in an effort to garner public support for new regulations.The fallout from the formaldehyde controversy is also likely to affect EPA's review and regulation of chemicals in the future. Although TSCA was amended in 2016 by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (Lautenberg Act) to give EPA new powers to review and regulate chemicals at the federal level, EPA does not always act with the expediency or methodology consumer advocacy groups may want. EPA is currently in the process of evaluating 10 \"high priority\" chemicals as mandated by the Lautenberg Act, and is already facing criticism from consumer groups who do not feel that EPA's framework for those analyses is comprehensive enough. And just as with the formaldehyde risk assessment, it is unlikely that industry groups will universally approve of the conclusions EPA reaches in connection with these new risk evaluations or the methodology it uses.As EPA's new evaluations progress and are released, we expect to see challenges from both consumer groups and industry groups similar to those launched over formaldehyde. The uncertainty those challenges will create will pose compliance difficulties for even the most proactive companies while regulations are tied up in litigation with unpredictable outcomes. Likewise, the heightened public interest in chemical evaluations means that companies may find themselves facing lawsuits and defending their products in the court of public opinionmdash;even if EPA concludes that certain chemicals pose no significant health risk to consumers.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

TMZ caught up with the Bellas and asked Nikki about the UFC flyweight champion's admitted crush[1] on her. After Brie joked that Daniel Bryan is a big fan of Cejudo and would probably go out with him, Nikki said, 'I mean, if I ever get back into that ring, I would love for Henry to train me. He's an unbelievable fighter and you know, I decided to send him some Belle Radici wine. Maybe I'll have a glass of wine with him one day or I don't know, we'll see.' As noted before, Nikki is reportedly dating[2] her former Dancing With The Stars partner Artem Chigvintsev, so a real date with Cejudo is probably out of the question.

Catalyst Game Labs has announced a new set of releases[1] now available in celebration of the anniversary including a new Beginners Box, a new full boxed set and the Shattered Fortress source book. BattleTech began life as a FASA Corporation product back in 1984, initially called BattleDroids but changed to BattleTech in second edition over concerns about Star Wars' rights to the word 'droid.' The tabletop game featured players designing and pitting mechs against each other in hexagonal-map environments. Several variants including CityTech, BattleTroops and BattleForce followed, as well as the tabletop roleplaying game MechWarrior set in BattleTech's expansive thirtieth century world. The products now available are, per the announcement: * The BattleTech Beginner Box is now available[2] in the Catalyst Game Labs store and through your local retailer. * The BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat boxed set is now available[3] in the Catalyst Game Labs store and through your local retailer. * The BattleTech sourcebook Shattered Fortress is now available through your local game store as well as the Catalyst Game Labs store! (print[4] // PDF[5] // both[6]) * The PDF version of the new printing of the BattleMech Manual is now available[7] in the Catalyst Game Labs store. The print version is at the printers now and will be out a bit later this year. This new printing includes an all-new cover bearing the 35th anniversary logo, and includes all errata from the previous printing. * Apparel bearing the BattleTech 35th Anniversary logo is now available for order, including a t-shirt and hoodie[8]. The previously announced pin will be available at a later time. * The re-released anniversary editions of the Warrior Trilogy novels are now available on PDF and Print on Demand.

Banking, Open Risk. Managing Financial Crime In A Disrupted World","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Open banking, openrisk. Managing financial crime in adisrupted world The financial services industry is changing faster than at any time in the last half century. New technologies, new entrants to the industry, new regulations and changing consumer preferences are combining to disrupt and fragment what was until recently an industry dominated by the major banks.Traditional retail banks face stiff competition from new market entrants, including challenger banks and technology-based financial service providers ('FinTechs'), that are often more agile and less constrained by costly legacy systems than their conventional competitors. At the same time, regulatory changes are creating a new \"Open Banking\" environment, that has the potential to diminish ownership of the customer relationship by larger retail banks.Our analysis and research, combined with the views of our clients, indicate that these changes will have a profound effect on financial crime risk management at both an institutional and market-wide level. New financial crime risks will need to be mitigated to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and fraud. Furthermore, we consider that existing approaches to financial crime risk management may become less effective at identifying and mitigating these risks, and that the roles and responsibilities of those involved in financial crime risk management will need to rebalance to reflect the shifts in the industry.Click here[1] for the full publicationThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) (UT) was asked to decide whether to impose an agreement allowing access to a building for the purpose of determining whether it was a suitable site for the installation of electronic communications apparatus.Statutory backgroundThe Code came into force on 28 December 2017, replacing the original telecommunications code. The Code sets out the basis on which electronic communications operators may exercise rights - referred to as \"Code rights\" - to deploy and maintain electronic communications apparatus on, over and under land.Under the Code it is possible, subject to various conditions, for an operator to seek an order for interim Code rights. These are Code rights granted for a limited period of time which do not benefit from the statutory continuation provisions.FactsHaving been forced to move equipment from one of its sites near Paddington station, Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Ltd (the Operator) had been relying on a temporary site to keep the local communications network running. The Operator therefore approached the University of London (UoL), requesting access to survey a student hall in Paddington to determine whether it would be a suitable site to permanently install its electronic communications apparatus.UoL did not want the apparatus on its building and refused to grant the Operator access to survey the site. Following further similar approaches and a subsequent stand-off, the Operator applied to the tribunal for an order for interim Code rights.UT decisionThere were three issues before the UT:Is a right of access to undertake a survey a Code right?The UT held that access to survey land and buildings is a right to which paragraph 3 of the Code (which sets out Code rights) applies.In so doing, the UT concluded that the rights to install equipment and carry out associated works in paragraphs 3(a) and (d) of the Code must be interpreted widely, so that it encompassed the preparatory works which the Operator sought. Giving judgment, Martin Rodger QC, Deputy President of the UT, noted that to do otherwise would undermine the key principle of the Code, namely to deliver communications networks quickly and economically to the public.Is an operator entitled to request an interim right without also, at the same time, seeking a permanent right?UoL argued that an application for an order imposing interim rights was contingent on an application for an order seeking permanent rights. However, the UT looked at the language of paragraph 26 of the Code and concluded that there was no requirement for the Operator to seek a permanent right at the same time as it sought an interim right.Had the claim for interim rights been made out in this case?The UT confirmed that an application for interim Code rights under paragraph 26 of the Code would only be granted if the Operator has a \"good arguable case\" that the conditions prescribed by paragraph 21 for the making of an order under paragraph 20 of the Code have been met, namely:The prejudice caused to the site provider (here UoL) by the order is capable of being adequately compensated by money; andThe public benefit likely to result from the making of the order is likely to outweigh the prejudice to UoL.On the facts of this case, the UT held that the Operator had demonstrated a good arguable case that this test had been satisfied. In coming to this decision it made the following observations:As part of its case, UoL quantified the costs it would incur for each site visit undertaken by the Operator, which showed that the prejudice could be compensated by money;The Operator was not required at that stage to adduce evidence concerning the amount of compensation or consideration that might be due;The Operator was not required to speculate about any particular prejudice that will be caused to UoL which they had not chosen to identify; and,The second limb of the test does not require a comparison to be made between the public benefit that would arise from the use of the site in question and another site, which is clearly operator-friendly.In conclusion, the UT held that as the agreement sought by the Operator was limited to a right of access during a limited period, the public interest outweighed the fairly small prejudice to UoL (which could be financially compensated).Accordingly, the UT made an order imposing an agreement for interim Code rights. This enabled the Operator to undertake the surveys and investigations required to establish whether the building was suitable for the installation of electronic communications apparatus.CommentThis decision confirms that the Code prioritises the provision of a choice of high-quality electronic communications services to the public, often at the expense of individual landowners.The case did not discuss the consideration that would be due to UoL in relation to the interim rights, which will be a key concern for landowners going forwards.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - January 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

\"Seguir� gobernando como presidente hasta 2025 con el apoyo c�vico-militar\"","content":"CARACAS.- El presidente de Venezuela, Nicol�s Maduro, asegur� este jueves que ninguna acci�n extranjera impedir� que concluya su mandato en 2025, y destac� que cuenta con el apoyo \"c�vico-militar\". \"Seguir� gobernando todos los a�os que me corresponde como presidente de la Rep�blica hasta el 2025, con el apoyo c�vico-militar\", se�al� Maduro durante la apertura del a�o judicial desde el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ), seg�n inform� la agencia 'Sputnik'.\nDurante su intervenci�n el presidente ley� el art�culo 233 de la Constituci�n de Venezuela y asegur� que en su pa�s no existe una falta absoluta del presidente, o al menos no en el marco de la Carta Magna.\n\"De acuerdo al 233 de la Constituci�n en Venezuela no hay una falta absoluta, ni ninguna de estas motivaciones, que nos llevar�an a otros escenarios, al contrario la lectura exacta de la Constituci�n dice que en Venezuela hay un presidente constitucional\", afirm� el mandatario.\nMaduro advirti� que el objetivo de Estados Unidos es \"intervenir a Venezuela y la forma es a trav�s de un presidente t�tere. En el mundo no queda duda que es el propio presidente Donald Trump quien quiere imponer un gobierno de facto, inconstitucional. Un golpe de Estado en Venezuela contra el pueblo y la democracia\", se�al�.\nPor otro lado, el jefe de Estado ratific� su decisi�n de romper relaciones diplom�ticas y pol�ticas con EEUU y de expulsar a todo su personal diplom�tico y consular de Venezuela. \"Hasta el domingo, tiene 72 horas para retirarse, para marcharse de Venezuela. As� lo ratifico\", declar� Maduro.\nLa tensi�n en Venezuela aument� despu�s de que este mi�rcoles el presidente de la Asamblea Nacional (parlamento unicameral), Juan Guaid�, se proclam� \"presidente encargado\" del pa�s frente una manifestaci�n opositora en las calles de Caracas.\nHasta ahora, Argentina, Brasil, Bahamas, Hait�, Rep�blica Dominicana, Canad�, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Panam�, Per�, Costa Rica, Honduras y Guatemala, adem�s de Albania y Georgia, reconocieron a Guaid�.\nEn el marco de la lucha contra la corrupci�n, el mandatario venezolano entreg� a los presidentes del TSJ, Maikel Moreno, y al presidente de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente (ANC), Diosdado Cabello, una reforma de la Ley contra la Corrupci�n que establece nuevos delitos, adaptada a \"los nuevos tiempos\".\n\"Propongo penas de 6 a 10 a�os para los que roben, revendan, y especulen con los productos regulados\", expres� en su discurso.","tags":["Venezuela","donald-trump.html"],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:52:34Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:52:34Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721753&p=4s5&v=1&x=7MYstM7Gf8vXgKLZVfmJeQ","commentsUrl":"http://economiavanzada.blogspot.com/2019/01/maduro-seguire-gobernando-como.html#comment-form","outboundUrls":["https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/tags/donald-trump.html","https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/internacional/2019/01/24/juan-guaido-autoproclamado-presidente-venezuela/991073.html"],"wordCount":"380","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38348165854","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"Central

Metropolitan Reit (CMA.AX): UO Reading Over 60 for This Stock","content":"The Ultimate Oscillator level is currently above 60 on shares of Centuria Metropolitan Reit (CMA.AX). Active traders may be closely following the indicator to see if overbought conditions are present at current levels. \n \nComing up with a viable and solid stock investment plan might be on the minds of many individual investors. A solid plan might entail defining the overall objective and recognizing tangible restraints. Figuring out these details may help the investor focus on the most important aspects of investing in the stock market. Following strategies set forth by others may work, but they may also leave the investor in a quandary. What worked in the past for one person may not work in the future for another. Investors may need to craft the plan keeping in mind the long-term goals. Although some investors and traders focus on the short-term, many investors are more interested in making the grade over a number of years, and not a number of days or months. Plans may need to be set up so that they are flexible and have the ability to withstand unforeseen shifts and rapidly changing stock market scenarios. Flexibility may end up being the key to a successful plan down the road. Investors may also want to do regular check-ins on portfolio performance in order to keep tabs on how well the plan is working. \n \nActive traders have a wide range of technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis. Currently, the 14-day ATR for Centuria Metropolitan Reit (CMA.AX) is spotted at 0.03. First developed by J. Welles Wilder, the ATR may assist traders in determining if there is heightened interest in a trend, or if extreme levels may be signaling a reversal. Simply put, the ATR determines the volatility of a security over a given period of time, or the tendency of the security to move one direction or another. \n \nInvestors may be tracking certain levels on shares of Centuria Metropolitan Reit (CMA.AX). The current 50-day Moving Average is 2.35, the 200-day Moving Average is 2.36, and the 7-day is noted at 2.37. Moving averages can help spot trends and price reversals. They may also be used to help find support or resistance levels. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators meaning that they confirm trends. A certain stock may be considered to be on an uptrend if trading above a moving average and the average is sloping upward. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward. \n \nTaking a quick look at technical levels and trend lines, we see that the stock has a 14-day ADX of 8.45. For traders looking to capitalize on trends, the ADX may be an essential technical tool. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would indicate a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would signify an extremely strong trend. \n \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book �New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems� which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. The 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 61.55, the 7-day is at 71.79, and the 3-day is spotted at 88.54 for Centuria Metropolitan Reit (CMA.AX). \n \nCenturia Metropolitan Reit (CMA.AX) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 165.22. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \n \nStock market investing can sometimes cause investors heads to spin. Following stocks on a daily basis, it is plain to see the amount of coverage that follows certain companies. This non-stop barrage of information may eventually become overwhelming for the novice investor. Filtering through all the data may involve taking a look at a company or stock from multiple angles. There are many investors out there that preach strictly following fundamental data. There are others that swear by the technical analysis. Many investors will opt to employ a research strategy that involves pieces of the two approaches. Knowing every little detail about a company may not be overly necessary, but it may help provide a bit more direction when navigating the stock market maze. Investors who put in the time to study all the fundamentals may want to also start watching the charts on stock that they are thinking about adding to the portfolio. Making sure that no stone is left unturned when examining a stock may end up being the difference between a big winner and a big loser.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:59:15Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:59:15Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721755&p=4s5&v=1&x=tOFR9qBcPXgni2kVeNXMOg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"898","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38345595431","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"INVESTMENT TRUSTS","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"TRENDS","score":"89"},{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"STOCK EXCHANGES","score":"90"}],"companies":[{"name":"Centuria Metropolitan REIT","symbol":"CMA","exchange":"ASX","isin":"AU000000CMA4","titleCount":1,"contentCount":5,"primary":true},{"name":"New Concepts Holdings Ltd","symbol":"02221","exchange":"HKG","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":false}],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"ATR"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"ATR"},{"name":"instances","value":"3"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.87"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"Comerica"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"CMA.AX"},{"name":"instances","value":"6"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"J.

The time horizon for each investor may be different. Fluctuations in the financial markets can have a big effect on shorter-term investments. Investors that need a certain amount of money in a shorter amount of time may be looking to develop a stock market strategy with a bit less risk involved. On the other end of the spectrum, a younger investor with a longer time horizon might be able to search for stocks with a higher potential for growth that may involve much more risk. The volatility of today�s markets can test the nerves of any investor. Understanding volatility and market fluctuations can help the investor gauge their risk tolerance in the markets. \n \nThere are multiple moving average indicators that traders may rely on when conducting stock research. One of the most popular is the Simple Moving Average. The SMA is unweighted, meaning that each period in the set of data is weighted equally. Looking at some SMA levels for Unifi, Inc. (NYSE:UFI) , we can see that the 10 day is 21.24918, the 20 day is 21.66564, and the 30 day is 22.529526. Tracking some other time periods, we note that the 50 day SMA is 22.595116 , the 100 day is 24.426659 , and the 200 day SMA is currently 25.920254. \n \nExpanding the technical focus for Unifi, Inc. (NYSE:UFI), we see that the Keltner Channels 20 day upper band is 22.271425, and the 20 day lower band is21.107975. The Keltner Channels indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. \n \nTracking the Hull Moving Average, we note that the current level is 21.336596. The Hull Moving Average was introduced by Alan Hull. Swing traders often use this indicator in combination with other signals in order to help identify possible entry and exit spots. \n \nTracking some one month stock pivot points, we note that the Classic Pivot is 20.933332, the Classic resistance 1 is 22.256666, and the Classic support 1 is presently 19.866667. The Fibonacci one month pivot is 20.933332 while the \nFibonacci support 1 pivot is 20.020353, and the Fibonacci support 2 is 19.456314. Looking at one month Woodie pivot, we note the level at 20.8925. The Woodie support 1 pivot is 19.785, and the Woodie resistance 1 pivot is 22.175. \n \nMany traders will look to optimize stock trades by using various technical indicators. The Ichimoku Cloud indicator is highly flexible and is commonly used in conjunction with the RSI to help confirm momentum and overall trends. Let�s focus on a few different Ichimoku readings: \n \nIchimoku Cloud Base Line: 22.265 \nIchimoku Cloud Conversion Line: 21.12 \nIchimoku Lead 1: 23.085 \nIchimoku Lead 2: 24.83 \n \nTraders focusing on technical analysis may be interested in following the Awesome Oscillator level. Currently, the reading is -1.305578. Typically, when the Awesome Oscillator moves above the zero line, this would indicate that the short term momentum is rising quicker than the long term momentum. A cross below the zero line would indicate that short term momentum is dropping faster than the long term momentum. \n \nTraders following shares of Unifi, Inc. (NYSE:UFI) may have noted that the stock most recently closed at 21.44. Going back a full-year, the stock has seen a change of -40.300583 over that stretch. Taking the focus in to more recent action, shares have seen a move of 3.7735848 over the last week. Over the prior month, the stock has moved -0.92378753. Over the past three months, the stock has moved -9.531843. \n \nWhen getting into the markets, most investors realize that riskier stocks may have an increased potential for higher returns. If investors decide to take a chance on some of these stocks, they may want to employ some standard techniques to help manage that risk. This may involve creating a diversified stock portfolio. Mixing up the portfolio with stocks from different sectors, market caps, and growth potential, may be the right move. In general, the goal is to maximize returns in accordance with the individual�s specific risk profile. It should be obvious that no matter how well rounded the portfolio is, there are always risks in the equity markets. Having a sound plan before investing can help ease the burden of knowing that markets can sometimes do crazy things without any rhyme or reason.

And Rwanda: Trade Mark Renewal Deadlines","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Trade mark owners with registrations in Burundi and/or Rwanda are reminded that certain trade marks need to be renewed this year in order to remain valid.BurundiTrade mark owners with registrations in Burundi are reminded that trade marks registered in Burundi before 29 July 2009 will have to be renewed before 29 July 2019 in order to remain valid.The current IP legislation, the Burundi Industrial Property Law, came into force on 28 July 2009. This law provides that all trade mark registrations obtained after this date have a ten-year term which is indefinitely renewable. Prior to 28 July 2009 trade marks were registered for indefinite terms.RwandaTrade mark owners with registrations in Rwanda should take note that trade marks registered in Rwanda before 14 December 2009 will have to be renewedon 14 December 2019 in order to remain valid.This relates to all trade mark registrations filed prior to the coming into force of Rwanda Law 31/2009 on the Protection of Intellectual Property (ldquo;the Lawrdquo;). The new Law, which is dated 26 October 2009, came into force following its publication on 14 December 2009. The provisions of the new Law require all trade marks filed under the previous arrangements to be renewed 10 years after the new Law came into force. Originally, the Registry advised that the renewal date would be 26 October 2019, and for a number of renewals filed early the Registry have issued certificates based on this information. More recently, the Registry have clarified that the renewal due date of old Law cases is 14 December 2019 (based on the date of publication), and have requested that certificates issued with the October date be returned for correction. We have already notified our clients in this regard.We encourage clients to proceed with the renewal of such cases as soon as possible. We confirm that the term of renewal in both jurisdictions will not be shortened.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

The new law, which came into effect in December, ends two-year \"humanitarian protection\" residency permits -- a lower level of asylum status based on Italian rather than international law -- that were awarded to 25 percent of asylum seekers last year.The Italian Refugee Council has said it was \"seriously concerned\" by the new legislation which \"will put thousands of people outside the law and only a very few can be repatriated.\"\"I do not think it's about security because sadly in a few months we will see the effects of this chaos they are creating on purpose,\" said the centre's legal advisor Rosanna Just. \"The only result is that they destroyed something that worked very well.\" The law also reorganises asylum-seeker management by closing large reception centres like Castelnuovo, which Salvini says are expensive and breeding grounds for criminals.Migrants and asylum-seekers were given 48 hours notice of the centre's closure, and on Tuesday the authorities began the evacuation of 500 people, including 120 women and 14 children.Some have been taken to reception centres elsewhere in the country, while others have preferred to head for Rome on foot before they are taken away.- Pope's visit -\"After having accompanied them, sometimes for years, on a path of integration, we had to tell them that they have to go, without even knowing their destination,\" said Just.\"The children were attending school, some (of the migrants) even had work and from one day to the next it's all taken away,\" she said.Dozens of the town's Italian's residents on Tuesday protested against the closure of the centre, which opened in a very different political climate 10 years ago.Pope Francis visited in 2016, celebrating mass and famously washing the feet of 11 migrants of different religions.\"It will be difficult to rebuild all this somewhere else,\" said Ehikwe, 27.\"I've been living here for two years, I don't know where I'll be sent, I don't know what will happen,\" said Ehikwe, a Roman Catholic who fled religious persecution in Nigeria, making the treacherous crossing of the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy. \"This is a common sense operation that will save Italians six million euros ($6.8 million) a year without taking anyone's rights away,\" Salvini said on Wednesday.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721634&p=4s5&v=1&x=oqkyHcfOuKmaY75wzXKt1A","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"520","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

online con falsi voucher Decathlon","content":"Truffe online con falsi �Voucher Decathlon�. Numerosi messaggi inviati tramite Whatsapp con l�utilizzo abusivo del marchio Decathlon. \n Truffe online  \nL�utilizzo abusivo di noti marchi con la promessa di falsi buoni spesa o di voucher da qualche centinaio di euro, costituiscono, come va ripetendo da tempo lo �Sportello dei Diritti�, un tentativo di frode che � diventato un tormentone anche se ancora ci sono tante, troppe persone che continuano a cascarci nonostante gli inviti a fare attenzione. \n \nLEGGI ANCHE: Offrono soldi spacciandosi per il sindaco \n I finti voucher  \nNel mirino di hacker e truffatori segnaliamo che ancora una volta � finita la multinazionale dello sport e del tempo libero Decathlon, che ovviamente del tutto ignara della vicenda, starebbe distribuendo, attraverso messaggini e per il tramite delle nostre messaggerie istantanee, voucher d�importo pari a 500 euro. Come sottolinea la  Polizia Postale  attraverso un post pubblicato sulla pagina Facebook �Commissariato di PS On Line � Italia�: �Ci giungono molte segnalazioni riguardo ad un messaggio WhatsApp : � Vinci un Voucher Decathlon di 500� �. L�azienda in questione smentisce categoricamente la paternit� dell�iniziativa. Il link presente nel messaggio stesso rinvia su un sito falso dove ci viene chiesto di inoltrare il messaggio ad altri utenti. Consigliamo di bloccare il mittente se sconosciuto ed eliminare il messaggio�. \n Mai rispondere  \nAncora una volta, rileva  Giovanni D�Agata , presidente dello �Sportello dei Diritti�, il modo migliore per difendersi, � quello di non rispondere mai a questi messaggi dal contenuto truffaldino e quindi di non cliccare sui link cui solitamente conducono o rispondere alle richieste di dati personali o bancari. Basta quindi cestinarli, cancellandoli dal proprio dispositivo e non contribuire a diffonderli, evitando di inoltrarli ai nostri contatti. Nel caso qualcuno sia comunque incappato nella frode si pu� rivolgere agli esperti dell�associazione tramite i contatti email info@sportellodeidiritti.org o segnalazioni@sportellodeidiritti.org. \n \nContinua la lettura di su La Nuova Periferia .","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:44:02Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:44:02Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721635&p=4s5&v=1&x=qjUDi5ZctXr6tRYuP0L4IQ","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"302","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38310496905","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://nuovaperiferia.it/media/2019/01/falsi-voucher-decathlon-125658.660x368-650x362.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Larceny + Theft","score":"93"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Fraud + Financial Crime","score":"80"}],"companies":[{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"DG","exchange":"WBO","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"STU","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"DG","exchange":"MIL","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"DG","exchange":"SWX","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"ETR","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"BER","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"FRA","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"DUS","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"MUN","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"DG","exchange":"PAR","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"SQU","exchange":"HAN","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"DGN","exchange":"MEX","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"VCISF","exchange":"PINX","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"VCISY","exchange":"PINX","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Vinci SA","symbol":"0NQM","exchange":"LTS","isin":"FR0000125486","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true}],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"name":"Elisa Giordano","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"209748","name":"La Nuova Periferia","homeUrl":"http://nuovaperiferia.it","category":"Local","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Italy","countryCode":"IT","region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"3.30","pageAuthority":"33.00","domainAuthority":"36.00","externalLinks":"33931","links":"53104"}},"feed":{"id":"635467664","name":"La Nuova Periferia","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"323"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940737622","id":"38350721636","language":"Italian","languageCode":"it","title":"Burger King Palazzo Nuovo ancora sotto assedio: nuove proteste degli studenti","content":"Ancora proteste al Burger King Palazzo Nuovo: studenti assediano i locali, tre vengono deferiti alle autorit�. Ma la multinazionale risponde: �Accuse infondate�. \nBurger King Palazzo Nuovo \nNuove proteste degli studenti ieri che hanno organizzato un flash mob per ribadire la loro opposizione al colosso del fast food che ha da poco aperto in uno degli stabili dell�ateneo torinese. Il locale al piano terra del centro Aldo Moro � stato affittato dalla multinazionale per i prossimi 30 anni ma sono molti i contrari sia fra gli studenti che fra i professori. \nFlash Mob \nDurante il flash mob, organizzato da �Noi restiamo�, gli studenti sono entrati nel locale per consumare il cibo portato da casa. Le forze dell�ordine sono intervenute in tenuta antisommossa per allontanare gli occupanti e sono poi state costrette a presidiare i tre ingressi del locale. Alcuni studenti hanno poi cercato di introdursi nel rettorato per avere un incontro con il rettore Gianmaria Ajani e i poliziotti sono dovuti intervenire caricando gli studenti che tentavano di aprire il portone di via Verdi con la forza. Tre di loro sono stati deferiti per il reato di resistenza a pubblico ufficiale. \nI motivi della protesta \n�Siamo contrari a questo progetto che fa entrare i privati con scopi commerciali all�universit�� spiegano i manifestanti. Non solo studenti universitari, anche molti professori dell�ateneo  sono contrari. Ma non � tutto. A poca distanza sorgono anche la scuola media Calvino e il liceo Gioberti e anche la dirigenza scolastica dei due istituti lamenta preoccupazioni: �invece di entrare in classe � possibile che molti studenti si riversino in questi locali�. \nLa proposta 5 stelle \nIntanto la giunta Appendino sta pensando a una legge per evitare l�apertura dei fast food  a meno di 400 metri di distanza dai luoghi frequentati dai minori e si prepara a combattere una guerra contro i due colossi. A breve infatti � prevista anche l�apertura di Mc Donald�s in via Sant�Ottavio, non molto distante anch�esso dalla zona di Palazzo Nuovo e sulla stessa strada della media Calvino e del liceo Gioberti. \nLa risposta di Burger King \nIn risposta a studenti e professori che protestano contro l�apertura del locale a Palazzo Nuovo Burger King risponde con una nota ufficiale: \n\nCome chiunque potr� verificare, sul sito dell�Universit� ( https://www.unito.it/ateneo/strutture-e-sedi/sedi/piano-di-sviluppo-edilizio/progetti-di-edilizia-universitaria/comples-0 ), � chiaramente riportato che la riqualificazione dell�area comprende la completa bonifica e progettazione degli spazi di Palazzo Nuovo e il progetto dei nuovi edifici dell�area del piazzale Aldo Moro per complessivi 50 mila mq di nuovi insediamenti a pi� livelli su una superficie di 10.500 mq. Il modello di insediamento � il �campus urbano�, in cui gli edifici universitari diventano strutture aperte, integrate e diffuse nel tessuto cittadino. Nell�ambito del progetto, l�Universit� di Torino occuper� circa 10 mila mq dedicati a: \nuffici, spazi per gli studenti (per un totale di 6 nuove aule con oltre 800 nuovi posti stimati), residenze universitarie. Il progetto del complesso prevede inoltre 5 mila mq destinati a servizi commerciali convenzionati. � all�interno di queste aree che ha aperto il ristorante BURGER KING�, su una superficie di 350 metri quadrati, che in questo momento ha come unico neo quello di essersi mosso pi� velocemente di altri. [�] Il progetto di riqualificazione dell�area prevede una concreta risposta alle esigenze di quanti lamentano scarsit� di spazi per le funzioni universitarie. Alcune aule sono gi� attive, altre dovrebbero essere consegnate il prossimo aprile e l�ultimazione del complesso a fine 2","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:53:33Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:53:33Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721636&p=4s5&v=1&x=ElN-JIJzEA1gE-sqU-Lj2A","outboundUrls":["https://www.unito.it/ateneo/strutture-e-sedi/sedi/piano-di-sviluppo-edilizio/progetti-di-edilizia-universitaria/comples-0"],"wordCount":"552","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721636","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://nuovaperiferia.it/media/2019/01/burger-king.png"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Teaching + Teachers","score":"91"},{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"Colleges + Universities","score":"76"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Student Financial Aid","score":"69"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"209748","name":"La Nuova Periferia","homeUrl":"http://nuovaperiferia.it","category":"Local","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Italy","countryCode":"IT","region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"3.30","pageAuthority":"33.00","domainAuthority":"36.00","externalLinks":"33931","links":"53104"}},"feed":{"id":"635467664","name":"La Nuova Periferia","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"323"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940737782","id":"38350721638","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"UPDATE 4-Vodafone holds off deploying Huawei in core network due to security row","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone, the world�s second largest mobile operator, said it was �pausing� the deployment of Huawei equipment in its core networks until Western governments give the Chinese firm full security clearance. \n\nThe United States and some allies, including Australia and New Zealand, have banned Huawei from 5G networks because of alleged ties to the Chinese government, while the firm has denied that its technology could be used by Beijing for spying. \n\nVodafone�s Chief Executive Nick Read said on Friday after reporting third-quarter results that the debate was playing out at a �too simplistic level�, adding that Huawei was an important player in an equipment market which it dominates along with Ericsson Sweden�s Ericsson and Nokia. \n\n�We have decided to pause further Huawei in our core whilst we engage with the various agencies and governments and Huawei just to finalize the situation, of which I feel Huawei is really open and working hard,� Read said. \n\nPoland is set to exclude Huawei from 5G after it arrested a Huawei executive earlier this month on spying allegations. Huawei fired the man, who has denied wrongdoing. \n\nEurope�s mobile industry would face higher costs and delays to faster networks if authorities imposed a blanket ban on Huawei equipment, particularly the radio technology deployed on mobile towers, Vodafone�s Read said. \n\nOperators in Europe such as BT and Orange, have already removed Huawei�s equipment or taken steps to limit its future use. \n\nRead said Huawei�s equipment was used in Vodafone�s core - which he described as the intelligent part of the network - in Spain and some other smaller markets. \n\nEuropean governments and security agencies had not pressurized Vodafone into taking the step, but the �noise level� had increased, and the debate now needed more facts, Read said, adding that governments in Africa and the Middle East, where Vodafone also uses Huawei, had not raised concerns. \n\nA spokesman for Huawei, which become the world�s biggest telecoms equipment maker earlier this decade despite being shut out of the U.S. market, said it had been a long-term strategic partner to Vodafone since 2007. \n\n�Huawei is focused on supporting Vodafone�s 5G network rollouts, of which the core is a small proportion. We are grateful to Vodafone for its support of Huawei and we will endeavor to live up to the trust placed in us,� he said. \n\nHowever, Read said that Vodafone had already agreed terms with a range of 5G suppliers, so moving away from Huawei in parts of the roll-out would not incur additional costs. \nTOUGH END TO YEAR \nShares in Vodafone fell after it reported a deterioration in its key revenue measure in the third quarter, down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 0.1 percent, reflecting price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. \n\nAnalysts had expected growth of 0.3 percent and the stock fell to its lowest level since July 2010 after the update,  trading down 2.9 percent at 140 pence at 1245 GMT. \n\nVodafone said, however, that competition in the Spanish and Italian markets had moderated through the quarter and it improved its level of churn, or the number of customers leaving, by two percentage points year-on-year. \n\nThe company�s Chief Financial Officer Margherita Della Valle said the performance improvements would start to show in the top line after the current quarter. \n\n�We expect as we enter into the next fiscal year to start seeing the benefits in terms of revenue growth,� she said. \n\nAnalysts at UBS said Vodafone performed well in net adds and churn across Europe, but they expected fourth quarter service revenue to drop to �0.5 percent, driven by weakness in Spain and tougher comparatives in Britain. \n\n�This is disappointing relative to prior comments that service revenues would be similar to the +0.5 percent seen in Q2,� they said. \n\nVodafone�s reiterated its guidance for this year of around 3 percent growth in underlying adjusted core earnings, with free cash flow before spectrum costs of about 5.4 billion euros.

Gilstrap Cautions On Tactics Directed Solely To PTAB Interests","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Court Takes Offense to Tactics Geared to PTAB AloneLitigants beware; Judge Rodney Gilstrap (E.D. Texas) warned litigants considered to be using the district court proceedings to posture positions in co-pending CBM proceedings that '[t]he Court does not countenancemdash;in fact this Court is offended bymdash;the strategic use of an Article III Court to gain a tactical advantage in any parallel proceeding.\"But, this dispute may be a preview of things to come as the Patent Trial ...peal Board (PTAB) aligns itself with the Phillips construction of the courts[1].In United Services Automobile Association v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2:18-CV-00245-JRG (E.D. Tex.), USAA brought a suit for patent infringement against Wells Fargo concerning four patents directed to remote check deposit technology. On September 18th of this year, Defendants filed a rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings on Section 101 grounds; Plaintiffs filed a response to the motion on October 26th. After Plaintiffs' filed their response, on Nov. 8th, Defendants filed four CBM proceedings on each of the asserted patents on 101 issues (which were seemingly tailored to address the district court arguments that plaintiff presented). Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint on Nov. 26th along with a motion to compel deposition of Defendant's expert witness in the CBM proceedings; on Dec. 12th Judge Gilstrap denied the 12(c) Motion as moot and gave Defendants leave to file a similar 101 motion within 15 days. The Defendants declined to file another 101 motion and represented that it would not file it again until after claim construction. Plaintiffs continued to insist on deposing Defendants CBM expert on the basis that the expert's positions were inconsistent with the arguments presented in the, now moot, 101 motion. The Judge heard oral argument as to the motion to compel expert testimony on January 10th, and subsequently denied the motion to compel.In his Order, (here[2]) Judge Gilstrap chastised both parties for what he appeared to consider gamesmanship. He seemed unhappy that Defendants filed a 101 motion for the apparent purpose of obtaining Plaintiffs litigation positions before filing its CBMs, especially since the Defendants declined to file a renewed 101 motion after the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The Judge was also apparently unhappy that the Plaintiffs sought to depose the Defendant's expert witness from the CBMs with respect to a moot motion. That deposition wouldn't really have any value in the district court (in light of there being no 101 motion), and instead was likely being sought for use in the concurrent CBMs.The Court explained, [T]he Court is persuaded that both parties have used (and continue to attempt to use) this Court as a mere tool to better posture their positions as regards the co-pending CBM proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \"PTAB\"). The Court does not countenancemdash;in fact this Court is offended bymdash;the strategic use of an Article III Court to gain a tactical advantage in any parallel proceeding. Such overtly demonstrates the parties' lack of recognition and reliance on the district court as a deliberative body. Moreover, such gamesmanship reflects a clear lack of respect for the Third Branch of our national government. This Court will not ignore such conduct. Given the PTAB's new 101 guidelines[3], and indeed, the risk defendants may be taking in pursuing a 101 challenge in parallel with a summary determination[4], it may be that this case is more of a preview of potential posturing downsides now that the PTAB has switched to a Phillips construction.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

CNIL commenced an investigation in September 2018, to determine whether Google had complied with Data Protection Act and the GDPR.Google was in breach. The CNIL found two main infringements:TransparencyCNIL found that Google did not provide sufficient information to users regarding how their data was to be processed, how long it was to be retained, or how it would be used in features such as ad personalisation. Information provided by Google regarding data usage was scattered and required multiple successive clicks to access, and in some instances 5 to 6 clicks. Furthermore, information provided by Google was not clear or comprehensive, and found to be generic. It contravened transparency obligations under Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR. Moreover, the information was not clear regarding the intent for processing users' data.Legal Basis to Obtain DataGoogle was found to have not collected sufficient consent from its users prior to collecting and processing data, particularly for ad personalisation. Firstly, users were not sufficiently informed regarding the range of the services, websites and other features involved in processing user's data. The services utilising this data included Google search, You Tube, Google Maps and several others.Secondly, when users created an account they are able to click a ldquo;More Optionsrdquo; button which would allow them to specify preferences, including altering how personalised ads are shown. The box permitting ad personalisation was already pre-ticked. This created an ambiguity. Had the user actually consented or just proceeded to use the site without turning their mind to the question of consent at all. Furthermore, in order to complete signing up with an account, users must tick a box specifying that they have agreed to Google's Terms of Service and to the processing of their information as described in sign-up and in Google's Privacy Policy. This consent afforded Google the ability to utilise user's data for an array of subsequent features. The CNIL held that this did not specify what features the consent was obtained for and as such, did not meet the threshold of providing a legal basis for processing personal data as per Article 6 of the GDPR.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

A Source Of Frustration?","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Limited and others v European Medicines Agency is the first major property dispute with Brexit at its heart and is currently being determined by the High Court. Depending on its outcome, the case may result in a flurry of Brexit-related litigation in the months to come. These are likely to involve much wider sectors such as banking, finance and trade and not be confined to the property market. The ramifications for the wider economy would be significant.  Background and factsIn 2011, the European Medicines Agency (the EMA) entered into an agreement for lease for a 25 year term in respect of Churchill Place - a newly-constructed 10 floor building in Canary Wharf. The lease was entered into in 2014, however it crucially did not contain a break right allowing for early termination.Following the result of the 2017 referendum on the United Kingdom's (the UK's) membership of the European Union (the EU), the EMA decided to relocate to Amsterdam. In June 2018, the EMA's landlord, Canary Wharf Group, issued a claim in the High Court for a declaration that Brexit (currently scheduled for 29 March 2019) and the relocation of the EMA will not frustrate the Lease - so that the EMA remains liable to meet all of its financial obligations under the lease for the duration of the term.Legal principle of FrustrationThe Courts can order that a contract (in this case a lease) is frustrated when an unforeseeable event (at the time of entering into the contract) happens after completion which makes it impossible (a) to fulfil the contract or (b) for the party to perform its obligations, as they have been radically changed. The principle is extremely difficult to argue in the courts and rare in its application.ClaimEMA's claimThe EMA is arguing that Brexit will amount to an event of frustration in relation to the lease. As an agency of the EU, the EMA's headquarters must be within an EU Member State. The EMA is therefore claiming that Brexit will amount to an event which would render the EMA's future performance of the lease impossible.Canary Wharf Group's claimThe Canary Wharf Group brought the case in an attempt to pre-empt the EMA's claim for frustration. They are claiming that Brexit was reasonably foreseeable as:The legal and political process for leaving the EU is enshrined in EU law under Article 50 and has therefore always been a possibility; andThe Conservative Party manifesto for the 2010 general election (1 year before the parties entered into the agreement for lease) contained a pledge to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.What next?The key question for the High Court is whether Brexit constitutes a frustrating event for the purpose of the lease. To help determine this, it is necessary to know what the parties may have been expecting when entering into the agreement for lease. Mr Justice Marcus Smith has therefore allowed each party to call an expert in modern British history and political science to give expert evidence on this issue.The Canary Wharf Group will be aiming for a ruling which avoids the EMA escaping its liabilities for the remainder of the term of the lease; however it is quite likely that the losing party will seek an expedited appeal to the Court of Appeal and possibly a leapfrog to the Supreme Court. The judgment of the High Court is expected to be published promptly and well before the 29 March 2019 withdrawal date as currently scheduled.CommentThe case is very significant as it is not just the UK property industry who is following it closely. If the judgment is in favour of the EMA, its ramifications could be widespread and may be applicable to a number of contracts and industries where European markets are at the heart of performance. To take a couple of examples, UK financial institutions who perform EU based obligations, UK exporters delivering to EU markets; even UK courier companies who deliver parcels to the EU may want to use the judgment to terminate or vary their existing contractual obligations.More generally, unless Brexit is avoided it is likely we can expect a marked increase in certain types of property disputes in 2019, notably:More break options being exercised by tenants;More cases where landlords challenge the validity of breaks; andMore attempts by parties to renege on contractual obligations which are no longer attractive in light of Brexit.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Timet Injunctions","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Vastint Leeds BV v Persons Unknown [2018] EWHC 2456 (Ch)Developers facing the risk of trespassers coming onto vacant development sites and causing substantial damage will welcome the High Court's decision in Vastint Leeds BV v Persons Unknown [2018] EWHC 2456 (Ch), where it ordered an injunction to prevent incursions by trespassers.The factsVastint is the developer of the site at the former Tetley Brewery in Leeds. With its development taking place in phases, parts of the site were left vacant. Despite putting a number of security measures in place, there had been a number of incidents of trespass/attempted trespass, involving caravans, which had resulted in clean-up costs of about 25,000. One of Vastint's group companies had also been the victim of various incidents at a site in East London involving illegal raves. Vastint also referred to the increase in \"professional\" fly-tipping operations causing significant delay and irrecoverable costs to developers. Vastint was further concerned that, as the development works progressed, there would be increased safety risks with buildings being structurally unstable and the presence of asbestos.To prevent the risks posed by travellers, those organising and participating in raves and illegal fly-tipping, Vastint applied to the Court for a quia timet injunction to prevent further incidents before they occurred. The developer considered that such an injunction would be a real deterrent to trespassers because of the penal notice it carries and attached risk of being in contempt of Court. Vastint further believed that it would help in getting assistance from the police (who, as developers will know, do not normally get involved in trespass of commercial premises unless proceedings are issued).Injunction against persons inknownIt is well established that proceedings can be issued and an order made against an unnamed defendant where:The name of the specific defendant is not known;There is a specific group/class of defendants but not all of their names are known; orThe defendants are defined by reference to their future act of infringement.It was this third category that was at play here. Judge Smith confirmed that an order could be made against such a category of defendants provided that the description of the defendants is sufficiently clear (i.e. it should not require a legal interpretation or be subjective).Quia timet injunctionsThis is a preventive injunction, where no wrong has yet been committed, but to prevent its occurrence. For such an injunction to be granted, the court will apply a two-stage test:There must be a strong probability that, unless restrained by injunction, there is a real and imminent risk that the defendant will breach the claimant's rights; andThe harm/damage caused by such an act will be so grave and irreparable that damages would not be an adequate remedy.If the above two tests are not met, the appropriate remedy will be for the claimant to seek an injunction once the damage/nuisance materialises.When considering these questions, the court will have regard to other steps that have been taken to prevent the issue (and whether the risk still exists despite those measures), the attitude of the defendant (this must suggest that the defendant is likely to commit the infringement), the timeframe of the infringement (in other words the risk must be imminent), and whether an interim injunction (after the event) plus damages would be an effective remedy having regards to the gravity of the anticipated harm.DecisionDespite expressing some doubt over the lack of evidence with regards to the intention/attitude of the potential trespassers because their identity was unknown, Judge Smith acknowledged that the security measures put in place by Vastint had been insufficient to prevent incidents of trespass. In the circumstances, he was satisfied that there was a strong probability of further incursions by caravans and those involved in or participating in raves. He therefore found that the first stage of the above test was made out in relation to those categories of trespassers.He was, however, not convinced that there was a real risk of fly-tipping, having seen no evidence other than this occurring at other sites in the country.As to the gravity of the harm that might be caused by trespassers, Judge Smith acknowledged that there were serious risks to life and limb to trespassers but also staff and contractors. In addition, he recognised that further incidents would likely result in significant costs to Vastint and that, although it could in theory be compensated by damages, the reality is that such costs are very unlikely to ever be recovered. It followed that the second stage was also made out and the injunction was granted.As the order was made against persons unknown, the judge sought to limit its ambit as clearly as possible so that it would only affect those it was intended for.CommentDevelopers who have been the victim of trespassers will be all too familiar with the delays and costs that such incidents can cause. Although this decision does not mean that such an injunction will be available in all cases (as there must be a real threat and risk of significant harm being caused), it may assist developers dealing with particularly problematic sites. It is, however, important to note that the Court will have regard to the other measures taken by the developer to limit the risk in the first place and the evidence of the risk in question.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - January 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

boycott organizations","content":"Jan 25, 2019( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  Contrary to statements by EU Foreign Minister Federico Mogherini (pictured) opposing Israel boycotts, the new MSA report reveals that funds continued to be transferred to organizations which promote boycotts against the State of Israel in 2017-2018. Minister Erdan to FM Mogherini: 'Instead of hiding behind empty statements, the European Union needs to implement its own declared policy and immediately cease funding organizations that promote boycotts against the State of Israel.' A comprehensive report released by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs (MSA) revealed that contrary to declared European Union policy and previous statements by EU Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, the EU has continued to transfer millions of euro in 2017-2018 to NGOs which promote boycotts of Israel. The report follows an earlier in-depth study published by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs in May 2018 regarding EU funding for Israel-boycott organizations during 2016. At that time, Minister of Strategic Affairs Gilad Erdan urged Mogherini to immediately cease the transfer of funds to these organizations. In response, the EU foreign minister replied that there were strict monitoring and verification procedures in place, assuring Minister Erdan that no European Union funds were being used to promote boycotts of Israel. Minister Erdan instructed his ministry to expand its examination of EU data published during 2017-2018, and found that despite Mogherini's statements, and contrary to official European Union policy of opposing boycotts, more than �5 million in funding was transferred to ten organizations promoting boycotts against the State of Israel. The MSA report also found that two of the most prominent Israel-boycott organizations, Al-Haq and Al-Mezan, were awarded a multiyear grant of over �750,000 from the EU which apparently began in 2018. These findings align with the findings of a recent report by the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the European Union's financial-audit body, which identified significant shortcomings in the EU's ability to monitor funds transferred to the numerous organizations receiving EU aid. The ECA warned that the European Union lacks sufficient information and transparency as to how these funds were distributed or spent. In light of the findings of the updated MSA report, Minister Erdan addressed Foreign Minister Mogherini in a letter, emphasizing the need to end the duality of EU policy which, on the one hand, officially opposes boycotts against the State of Israel, and on the other, supporting boycott organizations. He stated: 'In December 2018, the European Court of Auditors warned that the European Council does not have adequate and sufficiently detailed information as these NGOs use these funds,' and called on the European Union to 'immediately end funding for NGOs which actively promote a boycott of Israel.' Minster Erdan said that in light of the report's findings: 'The time has come for the EU to begin a deep reexamination of its policies. Instead of hiding behind empty statements, the European Union needs to implement its own declared policy and immediately cease funding organizations that promote boycotts against the State of Israel.'","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:47Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721661&p=4s5&v=1&x=yBdWUgGKz7tuPfOa6dZYbg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"547","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

Wick 3 Director Says Halle Berry Trained Her Character's Dogs","content":"Jan 25, 2019( 411mania.com: http://411mania.com Delivered by Newstex)  The director for John Wick 3: Parabellum has revealed that Halle Berry worked very closely with her character's dogs for the film. Chad Stahelski told Collider[1] that Berry worked with the dogs so that her character Sofia would be believable as the person who trained the animals to be attack dogs. 'We didn't want a trainer hiding behind a set piece or a prop or something like that,' Stahelski told the outlet. 'We wanted Halle�or, Sophia, our character�to be our on-screen dog trainer. So it wasn't acting like these were her dogs, these actually were her dogs. When we cast Halle we had the big talk. Halle actually came, after all her fight rehearsals and gun rehearsals, she would go sit, and work, and play with the dogs for months on end so the dogs on-screen actually obey Halle. They're not looking at a trainer. That was really fun.' The film will release on May 17th and stars Keanu Reeves, Berry, Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne, Anelica Huston, Jason Mantzoukas, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tiger Hu Chen, Yayan Ruhian, Cecep Arif Rahman, Lance Reddick, Common, and Ruby Rose.

10 most ridiculous Super Bowl LIII prop bets","content":"Welp. Let�s get silly. Super Bowl LIII is nearly upon us, and with it (hopefully) a great game between our Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots.\nAnd weird prop bets.\nWhat is a prop bet, ye who be not a degenerate gambler say? Certainly you, who has never spent a dollar on the dumbest minutiae of life that has nothing to do with the actual linear relationships of moments that matter but instead on the black matter in between that differentiates man from beast has no idea what a prop bet is. Allow me!\nA prop bet, or proposition bet, or novelty bet, or side bet, or softhook bet, or sushi bet (look, gambling has long operated in a level of shadows well below the light that requires a language all its own that is both malleable and temporal - try to keep up) is a bet that isn�t tied to the outcome of a specific event. So it�s not about who wins. Or by how much. Or the final score. Or any final outcome. Prop bets (et al) are about the stuff in between �now� and the final �then.�\nSo with that, here are your top 10 most ridiculous prop bets for Super Bowl LIII!\n#10.) Big Boi setlist inclusions\nSportsBettingDime.com\nShutterbug: 3/2\nMs. Jackson: 3/1\nRoyal Flush: 4/1\nB.O.B.: 5/1\nInternational Players Anthem: 6/1 (co-written by Big Boi and name-drops Gladys Knight)\nNOW LOOK. I AM QUITE BIASED. MY DAMN SCREEN NAME IS 3K (For those of you who don�t follow, Big Boi is part of a rap duo named OutKast that featured Boi and Andre 3000 hence �Three thousand� hence 3k. You should probably get off the internet and/or just use Facebook). IF THEY PLAY THE GODDAMNED INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS ANTHEM AND DRE DOESN�T COME OUT, THE GAME IS OVER. WE DON�T PLAY THE SECOND HALF. IF HE COMES OUT AND TELLS US ABOUT TYPING A TEXT TO A GIRL HE USED TO SEE, MAROOON 5 HAS TO BE SUMMARILY EXECUTED AT THE 50-YARD LINE. THIS IS HEREBY LAW.\n(I�m pretty sure I could get Roger Goodell to sign off on this.)\n#9.) Will Gladys Knight kneel during anthem?\nBetOnline.AG\nYES +150 \nNO -200\nGladys Knight is 74-years old. Four of the Pips are dead. If she can even kneel without help, we should all just be paying her out.\n#8.) Color of liquid poured on winning coach\nBetOnline.AG\nClear/Water +200 \nYellow +250 \nRed +300 \nBlue +700 \nPurple +700\nGreen/Lime +700\nThe great part here isn�t the sadness implicit in betting actual money earned by people who are not employed by the portions of the federal government that are currently not paying those employees on the color of the liquid poured on the liquid coach.\nNo, it�s the usage of the blanket term �liquid.� What are we including here? Gatorade, Powerade, Lucozade, sure. But something else is at play here.\nRamade? Have we finally cracked the code of the Rams� Fountain of Youth when it comes to their continued health?\nAre the Patriots up to something here that we don�t know? Did they take Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson�s nanobubbles and deflate them by 1psi? Lord knows I don�t trust them cheaters.\nAre we venturing into X-rated territory here? �Liquid� is a loaded term. Are we wagering on a team (hold up...just give it a sec...) blowing their load at the end of the game?\n#7.) Mercedes-Benz Stadium Roof Open at Kickoff\nBetOnline.ag\nYes   -200   (1/2)\nNo    +150   (3/2)   \nALL HAIL SUPREME ROBOANUS\n#6.) How many times will Ted Rath be mentioned during the broadcast?\nBovada\nOver 3.5 -190\nUnder 3.5 +145\n3.5?! The world has finally learned of our nutrijacked young boy because he holds Rams Head Coach Sean McVay back on the sidelines, and all the sudden he�s going to merit four mentions?!\nNo. The world should know of our strength and conditioning coach for more. Much more.\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {\n  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.2';\n  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nEpisode 3: Hard Work Pays Off\n�If he can come in and do what he�s been doing� bring him in, Coach. We�re trying to win a Super Bowl.� - Aaron Donald \n\nEpisode 3: Hard Work Pays OffPosted by Behind the Grind on Thursday, April 12, 2018\n\n#5.) Who will the Super Bowl MVP thank first\nSportsBettingDime.com\nTeammates: 5/6\nGod: 7/2\nMom/Dad/Family: 9/1\nCoach: 19/1\nFans: 24/1\nOwner: 50/1\nFIELD: 75/1\nDonald Trump: 5000/1\n5000/1. Cmon, man.\n#4.) Number of plays Tony Romo correctly predicts\nSportsBettingDime.com\nOver/Under: 2.5\nForget Jim Nantz. Just let Romo try to predict every single play.\n#3.) Will Maroon 5 play �Sweet Victory� at halftime as a SpongeBob SquarePants tribute?\nBovada\nYes -220\nNo +155\nI had to look this one up...but if they don�t do this after SpongeBob SquarePants creator Stephen Hillenburg passed away in 2018, they missed a real opportunity.\n\n(And yes, there is a chance well above 0% that Goodell somehow worries this will be too offensive)\n#2.) Rams CB Nickell Robey-Coleman called for pass interference during game\nBetOnline.ag\nYes   +200   (2/1)   \nNo    -300   (1/3)\nRude.\n#1.) Will Billy McFarland be caught selling counterfeit tickets to the Super Bowl?\nBovada\nYes +2500\nNo -10000\nScrew this.\nOdds that Billy McFarland is the NFL Commissioner in 2025: 3/2.\nDon�t @

Here's our review...  This review contains spoilers. See related Marvel hires Blizzard veterans for new video game project[2] Cyberpunk 2077: \"far, far bigger\" than The Witcher 3[3] The enduring appeal of Blizzard's Overwatch[4] 6.3 The Tattler Jake Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood best friends, did you know that? I'd forgive you if you didn't, because though Brooklyn Nine-Ninemade this fact apparent in its first season, since then, this piece of joint character history has sort of receded into the background. Actually, come to think of it, Gina has faded into the background a bit as well. It might just be me, but I've found that the perpetual scene-stealer has had less and less to do on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, to the point that when Chelsea Peretti went on maternity leave from the show, things moved along smoothly without skipping a beat. When you have an ensemble as big and well-defined as Brooklyn Nine-Nine's, it's easy for certain characters to get lost in the shuffle, and that has seemed to happen with Gina. Peretti's first stint away from the show probably convinced her, as well as the writers, that the show could survive Gina's absence, hence the announcement ofher planned departure late last year that the show's sixth season on NBC would be Peretti's last. Now this week and next the show will take the opportunity to say goodbye to the character (though hopefully not for good). The first part of this long goodbye, The Tattlerfinds Jake and Gina, or as they used to be known back in high school, the Dope Denim Crew, preparing for their high school reunion. Though Gina is excited to lie to her former classmates to inflate her ego, Jake is a bit more worried about the event due to some unresolved high school drama. It turns out that back in high school, Jake was accused of tattling on the coolest kid in school, though he is steadfast in his claim that he was not the one that tattled. Once at the reunion, Jake realises that his nickname, the Tattler, has stuck, and he spends the rest of the evening using his detective skills with Amy to clear his name once and for all. A high school reunion would have been a perfect example to show some flashbacks to Gina and Jake's heyday as friends, but the episode only utilises one brief flashback, with Andy Samberg of course portraying his younger self, and mostly keeps Jake and Gina apart for the majority of the episode. Gina is able to get a couple of very on-brand lies out to her former classmates, but her role in the episode really isn't much bigger than her typical presence on the show. What should have been a full-length tribute to the Jake and Gina relationship is mostly relegated to the episode's last three minutes, when Jake discovers that Gina was in fact the tattler, but only did so to keep Jake from falling in with the wrong crowd of kids. Jake recognises Gina's fierce loyalty and unwavering self-confidence, and in a meta-explanation of the very funny Peretti's predicament, wonders if her talents are being wasted at the Nine-Nine. Gina agrees that there are bigger fish for her to fry and formally announces her decision to leave the precinct. The decision feels a bit rushed, but thankfully, we have another whole episode to properly bid farewell to Brooklyn Nine-Nine's most colourful character. Elsewhere, Rosa is forced to choose between two potential suitors when they discover through an Instagram photo that she is seeing both of them. The always indecisive Boyle tries to help her make her choice, first with a 309-question questionnaire and then with a technique called 'the upside down coward,' but in the time it takes to decide between the two lovers, one takes themselves out of consideration. This outcome is perfectly Boyle, who says that when you're often indecisive, the universe will make your decisions for you. While watching these two work on Rosa's relationship issues, it's interesting to remember the characters' dynamic in season one and just how good of a job the writers have done at rehabilitating Boyle from a creepy 'nice guy' to a genuinely well-meaning weirdo. Lastly, the C-plot finds Holt, Terry, Hitchcock, and Scully trying to win a radio competition by identifying an unknown crinkling sound. It's mostly inconsequential, but does feature some good digs at Terry from Holt and some always welcome Hitchcock and Scully nonsense. In the end, Holt learns that not every minute of work needs to be productive, or something. So while The Tattlerdoesn't make the most out of honouring Jake and Gina's former selves, it still features quite a few solid jokes and sets us up comfortably for Gina's grand goodbye. Next week will surely be more special than this. Read Nick's review of the previous episode, Hitchcock ...ully, here[5].

The challenge follows a global survey by Future Females and another community of global entrepreneurs, Startup Grind[4], of over 20 000 female entrepreneurs carriedoutlastyear, which found that 51% of respondents listed 'mindset' and 'confidence' as the main challenge holding them back from business success.Future Females' 5 Days to Start challenge will take place between 4 and 8 FebruaryThe challenge will take place online, with a video tutorial released each day, accompanied by a workbook for members to put their new knowledge to use and finally get started on bringing their ideas to life. Members will also have access to a private Facebook Group, where they can share their progress and keep up to date with what the other members are doing.Here's what you'll learn Day 1 - Mindset shift:Get your head in the game, break through your self-limitations and unlock your full entrepreneurial potential. Day 2 - Define your idea: Get your idea out of your head and down on paper, and refine this until you've identified the most productive and profitable product to start with. Day 3 - Brand definition: Build an enviable and memorable brand that will draw the right customers, staff and media to your business. Day 4 - Find your niche: Find your tribe online, these are the exact people who will buy what you're selling, and become loyal advocates of your business.

Peterson � Twelve Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos","content":"TL:DR - This book was the worst garbage I have read in a long time. I am very glad I pirated a copy of it.\n\n \n\nI don't get it.\n\nI consider myself fairly open minded. I have in the past read books by people who expound political beliefs I disagree with, just to see whether my own beliefs really hold up. I am willing to put in the work to do that because I think it is only fair. That being said, I am a person who participates on the internet, and thus I have an opinion on Jordan Peterson.\n\nIt�s not a flattering opinion. But I wanted to see if his book would hold up to any kind of rigor. I have read a few self-help books in the past, and so I figured I could judge this one on that criteria alone.\n\nJordan Peterson�s 12 Rules is a self-help book. It proposes (spoilers) twelve rules which we are meant to follow in order to live a better life. That being said, I am not in any way convinced that that is all it is intending to be. Each rule is supplemented with his justification for that rule, and thus justification are loaded with his politics and his mysticism, which is much worse. Thus the book struck more as masquerading as self help, and really functioning as promotion of Peterson's own beliefs.\n\nMy first reaction to this book was �Wow, he really does go on about lobsters.�\n\nLater, I began to notice more and more assertions thrown into the mix, which bothered me because the book is almost barren of any cited sources. You just have to take Mr Peterson�s word for all the things he says. As far as I can tell the reason he doesn't bother with citations is because he is making all of this up. Normally a self-help book relies on some kind of science for the claims it makes. Peterson wants to support his claims with his own off brand of mysticism.\n\nI was extremely skeptical of Jungian archetypes and collective unconsciousness well before Peterson rolled around, and if I had to credit this book with something it would be helping me elucidate why, anyone can read anything they want into them, and at the end of it all there is pretty much nothing we can look at that points to reality. As an example, at some point Peterson refers to Christ as the �archetypal perfect man�. He says this in context of why Jesus should be permitted to do something that you shouldn�t. Rather, why lowly humans such as yourself shouldn�t use Jesus as your conceptional model. This makes no sense that I can establish, and is the type of sophistry that I cannot handle. If someone is perfect, then their actions should be emulated in all contexts. If there behavior isn't correct, that individual isn�t fucking perfect. Oh, he was being metaphorical? Then what is the point of bringing it up at all? These words have no meaning whatsoever, at least when Peterson uses them.\n\nAt some point my kindness finally cracked and I saw Peterson for what he is, a jargon heavy woo-peddler.\n\nThere was something about the way the introduction was written that really hit me with the impression that this book was first and foremost about Jordan Peterson, and that helping other seemed at best secondary. Or perhaps that helping others was how Peterson actualizes his ego. I don�t know, I�m not a psychologist.\n\nThis book was the worst garbage I have read in a long time. I am very glad I pirated a copy of it.","tags":["Longer Views","Non-Fiction","Schlock","Self-Help","12 rules for life","Book","Book Review","Jordan Peterson","Psychology"],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:20Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:41Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:20Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350720982&p=4s5&v=1&x=gL1sdxjD8U01g5r3C_nkPw","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"606","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350720982","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{"itemId":"323"},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"RELIGION","score":"76"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"NON FICTION LITERATURE","score":"90"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Jordan B.

Spoilers ahead in our review of Ruin...  This review contains spoilers. See related Marvel hires Blizzard veterans for new video game project[2] Cyberpunk 2077: \"far, far bigger\" than The Witcher 3[3] The enduring appeal of Blizzard's Overwatch[4] 5.4 Ruin It's funny. Gotham can really be a series with absolutely no restraint. It's a show that, at times, can't seem to resist camp and excess, but at other times it can be a classy drama that allows viewers to truly experience poignancy. That's how we begin things this week with the aftermath of the explosion that took down Jim Gordon's Haven. The episode, appropriately titled Ruin, allows for each of our major players to have a reaction to the utter destruction of the only safe zone in Gotham City. We get to see Gordon's response to the death of the young orphan he befriended, we get to see the same grieving man spring into action as a true leader, and we witness Barbara forgoing her revenge on Penguin to help the survivors of the blast. We even watch Penguin's complete shock in the face of true evil. It's like, for a brief moment, the excess and camp were blasted away when Haven went up in flames. For that same short instant, Gotham felt like a really effective episode of The Walking Dead. And that's a good thing because it proves that through all the Theo Galavans, and magic seeds, and dead-end storylines, this series has made us care about its beloved icons. And Gotham stays focused this week with three concurrent storylines. First we have the aftermath of the Haven attack. Gordon, Bullock, and Penguin all try to find the culprit that killed so many at haven. It looks like there's a lead when our trio of unlikely allies and their men chase down a mystery man seen leaving the scene of the attack. That man is none other than the returning Victor Zsasz! Penguin instantly demands Zsasz's head, because after all, Zsasz recently betrayed Penguin to Sofia Falcone, but Gordon wants evidence before he will condemn the scarred up gun for hire. Which brings us to our second of three storylines; it's been a week since we've seen Edward Nygma. Good 'ol Ed is trying to find clues over what his other persona is doing when in control. This week, Nygma's detective work leads him to a Blackgate inmate. Nygma goes to the GCPD and tries to steal the file. He runs into Lucius Fox, who promises to give Ed the file if the brilliant criminal will help him investigate the rocket attack. Now listen, just seeing Lucius and Ed together for 90 seconds makes me long for a police procedural starring these two Bat icons. Nygma discovers that the explosion that took down parts of Haven was caused by an RPG and not a bomb, so it would be impossible for Zsasz to have perpetrated the attack. So now we have these two stories converging as Gordon stands up for Zsasz. Gordon does not want to see justice fall apart in the No Man's Land that Gotham has become, so the Penguin/Gordon alliance is already fraying. Penguin demands a trial and we get a little Dark Knight Rises kangaroo courtroom action as Penguin finds Zsasz guilty. Gordon busts it up and frees Zsasz. Now I get the whole justice thing, but yo, this is Victor freakin' Zsasz, a dude who cuts scars into his own flesh every time he offs someone. Is it really wise to have this guy on the streets? Well, Zsasz does have a strange sense of honour, so maybe somewhere along the way Zsasz could help Gordon when the future commissioner least expects it? Until then Jim Gordon has released a serial killer into the wilds of a lawless Gotham filled with vulnerable people. Huh. Whatever your feelings on Zsasz, the alliance Gordon made with Penguin has seemed to hit a major snag, but it looks like Jimmy boy might have reignited an old union, one that goes back to the very first episode of Gotham. Yes, Gordon and Barbara Kean are a thing again. This week the episode ends with a Barbara/ Jimbo lip lock. Now here's a relationship that has been through some ish! Between Tabitha, Ra's Al Ghul, Sofia Falcone, Leslie Thompkins, Valerie Vale, and so many more, there's been some drama since Gordon and Kean ended their engagement. But No Man's Land makes strange bedfellows and the alliance between the GCPD and the Sirens has now been sealed with a kiss. But we're not done, because despite the rekindling of romances, the betrayals, and the hooks ups, there were two huge unexpected twists during the fourth instalment of the final season of Gotham. First we learn who shot the RPG that took down Haven. Edward sees that there's an old woman living across from the rooftop that the RPG was fired from. Edward confronts the wheelchair-using old lady and discovers it was Edward himself who fired the fateful rocket. Yep, when Ed's other persona took over, he went on a murdering spree. Edward tosses the lady from a window (well, maybe Gotham got a little excessive this week) and now he must deal with the fact he has a monster living inside him. This should take us to some interesting places. And now we must talk about the most unexpected twist of all. Last week Selina fought Ecco Harley and handcuffed Bruce, all so she can find and take down Jeremiah. This week that hunt comes to an end. Bruce is freed by Alfred, but by that time Selina is deep in Jeremiah's territory. He is digging a tunnel under Gotham using labour drones provided by Ecco's initiations. Selina infiltrates the group and we're all expecting her to have an epic battle with Ecco, or Jeremiah, or both so Selina can get revenge for Jeremiah paralysing her. Now this is where I should tell you that I really enjoy the interactions between Ecco and Jeremiah, they are truly a, well, echo, of the classic Joker and Harley (and now I get the meaning of Ecco's name�well played, Gotham). I should tell you that I'm looking forward to more of this twisted Bonnie and Clyde. But I can't, because when Selina sees Jeremiah she just quickly and efficiently, stabs him to death. No prolonged battle, no soul searching over whether the killing would be just. Selina just shivs Jeremiah right in front of Bruce and Alfred. Well damn, that's some empowerment right there. Now I know we're in a show where death doesn't mean much, but that would be a hell of a way to write Jeremiah out and also give the spotlight to Ecco. So Jeremiah is dead, Edward Nygma is the biggest monster in No Man's Land, Penguin is pissed, and Gordon and Barbara are a thing again. It's easy to say that Gotham heated up in a big way this week to deliver another memorable episode. Read Marc's review of the previous episode, Penguin, Our Hero, here[5].

condemns violence against women at World Youth Day","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  Pope Francis said Latin America had to address the \"plague\" of femicide, as well as drug and gang violence. He also slammed anti-migration rhetoric built on \"fears and suspicions.\"Pope Francis was in Panama on Thursday for World Youth Day � an annual Catholic event that actually takes place over five days. He used the trip to condemn violence against women in Latin America and to blast \"fears and suspicions\" of foreigners and immigration.In a speech at a church named, like the pontiff, after St. Francis of Assisi, he spoke of the \"plague\" of femicide. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, around 2,800 women are killed in the region each year.\"The killing of women -- our continent is experiencing a plague in this regard,\" said Francis, the world's first South American pope. He also spoke of the toll drug trafficking and gang violence has taken on Latin America.\"Often families have been broken by an economic system that did not prioritize persons and the common good.And so, we see our young people without a home, without a family, without a community, without a sense of belonging, easy prey for the first charlatan who comes along.\"Pope: The church should foster acceptance of foreignersLater, in an early evening gathering of tens of thousands of young people at a park overlooking Panama Bay, the pope received a rock-star welcome.Read more: Capitalism-weary Pope Francis visits free market-loving BalticsFrancis stressed that he did not want to create \"a parallel Church,\" that would be thought of as \"cool\" by young people, but rather sought \"constant freshness and youth\" in the Church's activities.He also used the opportunity to speak about immigration, especially poignant at a time when the White House is accused of stirring up suspicion against the Central Americans fleeing crime and poverty who want to come to the United States.The pope told a group of bishops that the Church should foster acceptance and help facilitate \"dialogue and help overcome fears and suspicions, and thus consolidate the very bonds that migrations � in the collective imagination � threaten to break.\"es/rc (AP, AFP)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

Hearts: why Mickey Mouse only had a cameo in the first game","content":"Jan 24, 2019( Den of Geek: http://www.denofgeek.com Delivered by Newstex)  Matthew Byrd[1] Jan 25, 2019 Disney placed severe restriction on Mickey Mouse's use in the original Kingdom Hearts...  The Kingdom Hearts series may be a beloved success, with Kingdom Hearts 3set to serve up the sequel we've all been waiting for,[2] but there was a time when Square Enix had to convince Disney to let them work with so many beloved properties. While the pitch process was mostly smooth, Disney did place one major limitation on Mickey Mouse. See related Marvel hires Blizzard veterans for new video game project[3] Cyberpunk 2077: \"far, far bigger\" than The Witcher 3[4] The enduring appeal of Blizzard's Overwatch[5] \"Actually, due to contractual issues, we were only able to use him in one scene,\" said Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura in theKingdom Hearts Ultimania book[6]. \"Disney gave us permission for a role such as waving from the back of a crowd of people in town, but if we were going to use him, I thought we should use him in a single shot to leave the greatest impression.\" The shot that Nomura is referring to happens near the very end of Kingdom Hearts. It is then that we finally see Mickey Mouse (or at least the back of him) as he helps Sora close the door to Kingdom Hearts. We'd say that's certainly better than seeing Mickey wave from the back of a crowd even if it isn't quite the role many fans imagined for the iconic character when Kingdom Hearts was first announced. What's less clear is why Disney placed such a noticeable restriction on Mickey Mouse. The popular theory is that Mickey is essentially the company's global icon at this point and that they have to be very careful about how that icon is used. It all worked out in the end, though. Not only was the use of Mickey Mouse in Kingdom Hearts quite effective, but the success of the game led to Disney giving the Kingdom Hearts team the green light to feature Mickey more prominently in future titles. Mickey has arguably become one of the main characters at this point in the series. That's not the only corporate hurdle that Square Enix has had to overcome. A full report on the nature of the Kingdom Hearts/Disney relationship reveals that Pixar's involvement was reportedly delayed by former Disney CEOMichael Eisner's bad relationship with Pixar. Fortunately, his resignation led to Disney loosening the creative restrictions on Pixar properties[7]. Kingdom Hearts 3 is out now in Japan, with the rest of the world getting it on January 29th 2019.

circumnavigate the Australian continent and popularise the country's name have been found near a busy London railway station.Archaeologists sifting through a vast burial ground near Euston station said Friday they had found a coffin plate identifying the last resting place of Royal Navy captain Matthew Flinders. Flinders was buried on 23rd July 1814, but not before publishing \"A Voyage to Terra Australis,\" which described his circumnavigation of Australia in 1802-1803 that proved it was a continent.\"Flinders put Australia on the map due to his tenacity and expertise as a navigator and explorer,\" said Helen Wass, an archaeologist overseeing the dig for the HS2 high speed rail project.With an estimated 40,000 remains at the site, archaeologists were not sure they were going to find Flinders, whose resting place had been subject to much speculation. \"We were very lucky\" said Wass, he \"had a breastplate made of lead meaning it would not have corroded.\" \"We'll now be able to study his skeleton to see whether life at sea left its mark and what more we can learn about him.\"Flinders is a hero for many Australians of European origin, with stations, streets, squares and towns across the country named after him.The discovery of his remains comes on the eve of \"Australia Day\" a controversial national holiday which falls on the date of the arrival of the British First Fleet to Australia. Many Australians view the Fleet and men like Flinders as harbingers of the decimation of ancient Aboriginal societies and cultures.There is added controversy over the role of an aboriginal Australian aide to Flinders named Bungaree, who has been largely eclipsed by his British captain, but who historians now believe played a crucial role in success of the voyages.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:41Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350720990&p=4s5&v=1&x=9VuVsWd_kQWy_2woHhyxnQ","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"315","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

One of the best moments of my adult life was when I had my first thing poking up. See related Marvel hires Blizzard veterans for new video game project[2] Cyberpunk 2077: \"far, far bigger\" than The Witcher 3[3] The enduring appeal of Blizzard's Overwatch[4] Possibly that needs context. Let's start at the beginning. About 18 months ago, I turned up at the doctor's and went \"ALL MY TEETH ARE GOING TO FALL OUT!\" (Spoiler alert - no they weren't.) Then I started crying a bit. My doctor, instead of calling me a \"toothless div\" like I would have done, came up with the idea that maybe I was a bit highly strung. He gave me a prescription and suggested I do something relaxing. Relaxing you say? What could be more relaxing than staring at the wall and worrying about everything that could possibly happen in any possible universe? Turns out this wasn't the best hobby for someone with anxiety. I had a think about what I could do that might be relaxing. The answer came when my mother in law asked me if I'd mind helping her to do some gardening. There were a few snags, the main one being that I'd never done any gardening before. \"Will you weed that bed?\" \"Which ones are the weeds?\" (Half an hour TED Talk, complete with slideshow, about which ones are the weeds) \"OK\" (Pulls all the flowers out and leaves the weeds) Luckily my mother in law is nice, and she didn't mind too much. She let me loose on the rest of the garden, and I'm proud to say it didn't end up going on fire or exploding. There's something engrossing about working outdoors, even if you're doing great hulking manual labour (lifting a spade). I found that I'd lost myself in my work for an entire afternoon; I only stopped because my mother in law suggested that it might be nice to go inside now that it was dark. There's so much going on in a garden, you can't really help forgetting your problems for a bit. For example, in my mother in law's garden, you start off digging up a shrub, then you notice some weeds (once you get to the stage of being able to identify any weeds), then you do some mild sweeping. Then - and this is the best bit - you have a cup of tea, stopping to sit and look at all the things you've accomplished. You could have a wander round checking all the flowers are still there, or look at the shed and go \"that needs some paint\" then tut, or maybe your attention will be taken by a sparrow that's landed near you. \"That's all very well\" I hear you say. \"But we don't have massive huge gardens to knob around in.\" Well, neither do I really. Helping the mother in law is only an occasional thing, made even more infrequent by her recent decision to have her garden redone to be as low maintenance as possible. I do, however, have a tiny balcony stuck to my flat. Mostly the balcony had been used for smoking on and not much else, but last spring, having been bitten by the gardening bug, I bought a packet of random flower seeds, and I planted them in a pot. Ignore the fact that I tipped half the entire packet into the pot because I had no idea what I was doing, and that I also had to Google \"does soil go off\". Weeks went by, calendar pages were ripped off by unseen hands, and I kept watering my pot, certain that nothing would grow, and that I'd killed any chance these flowers ever had at life because I was a terrible person. Then one morning, I checked my pot and saw this:  I woke my other half up by shouting \"I'VE GROWN A THING! I'VE GOT A THING!\" He was possibly less enthusiastic than I was. Let me tell you - when you've grown a thing, you are proud of your thing, and nothing can take that away from you, not even your own stupid party-pooping brain. I found I had something to focus on other than my worries and perceived failures. I was, after all, responsible for a thing now. To my amazement, more things kept popping up until I had to move some of them into tin cans and old Quality Street tubs. These flowers were, despite having me as their guardian, determined to grow. And I eagerly studied every millimetre. I was like a woman possessed. I scoured books and gardening websites, learning terms like 'pricking out' and 'loamy soil'. And I forgot to wake up each day feeling like hell, because now I had something new to think about. It's only now, looking back, that I realise how much good my little balcony garden did me. At some point over that summer, I discovered a coping technique I didn't know I'd been missing. Gardening didn't solve any of my problems, but it did give my mind a much needed holiday. Ask any gardener, and they'll agree that working with nature has that effect, whether it's a huge garden or one single plant pot overlooking a main road. Gardening reminds you that there is other stuff out there, that you're not the centre of the universe, and that, most of the time, the world finds a way to manage. I'll always be grateful to my thing for helping me to remember that (my thing grew up to be a zinnia, in case you were wondering). Of course, I always have to take things too far, and now I've applied for an allotment, because I am apparently cosplaying as Arthur Fowler. In my mind, I will have rows and rows of fruit and veg. In reality, I will have one growbag with five peas in it. But that's not the point. I'll have space where I can grow stuff, where I can dig soil just for the hell of it, and most importantly, somewhere to just go and relax when I need to. Maybe I'll get a shed so I can sit in it and tut and say things like \"I must start chitting my potatoes soon\". And I can't think of anything more relaxing than that. If you're stressed, get a pot and put some seeds in it, even if the pot just lives on your windowsill. You never know where it will lead. Who knows, we might even end up becoming allotment buddies. If we do, I promise to save some tea in my flask for you.

Or that 21-year old Josh Jackson qualifies as a �veteran� with more NBA experience than half the rotation because he�s in his second year? Or that the team�s best talent keeps sustaining injuries? The list goes on.\nThursday night�s game against the lackluster Blazers started off the bat looking winnable. The Suns had a 47-41 lead late in the second quarter, and were still within a point (73-72) late in the third, but eventually their litany of injuries caught up with them.\nStarting center Deandre Ayton and backup Richaun Holmes have been out all week with ankle injuries. Starting forward and second-leading scorer T.J. Warren is out indefinitely with a deep bone bruise in his ankle. Then in the third quarter, starting guard De�Anthony Melton came up lame after a putback.\nMissing four rotation players eventually put the Suns in a tailspin from which they couldn�t recover. Any team that�s forced to play Dragan Bender and Quincy Acy 48 minutes at center, and Elie Okobo and Jamal Crawford all the point guard minutes is going to suffer. Hard.\nWith the trade deadline looming in two weeks, will the Suns add reinforcements via the trade market?\nDon�t hold your breath. Suns interim GM James Jones says the Suns won�t make a panic trade, per a radio interview with Burns and Gambo this week.\n\n�If you do something because you feel pressure � you do something short-sighted � it always ends up coming to bite you in the end,� he said.\n�The reason a lot of these players are available is because their teams don�t think they fit long-term. Your teams think those guys are declining in value and so they�ll try to push them upon you and if you�re desperate and they know that�s something that you need they�re hopeful that they can trick you into setting yourself up for short-term success but long-term failure.�\n\nClearly, Jones is not inclined to execute a trade just to add someone who can play basketball at an NBA level. If he makes a trade, he�s looking for someone who can help long term. \nWould any acquisition be an older player, like someone along the lines of last year�s free agent acquisition of Trevor Ariza (33 years old), 2017�s top choice in Jared Dudley (32 at the time) and 2016�s top free agent Tyson Chandler (32 at the time)?\nNo.\n�We�re focused on adding veterans, just not the veterans that are at that declining point.�\nJones has seen what happens. It�s like a generational gap.\n\n�For the most part, our team is all under 22,� Jones said. �So if you try to add someone that�s 33-34 years old, it usually just doesn�t work. There�s too big of a gap.�\n�Especially when you factor in the speed and the pace of the game has increased,� Jones said. �The elite players, there�s very few of those guys between the age of 32 to 35 that maintain a high level and take a jump.�\n\nThat likely takes the Suns completely out of the Mike Conley Jr. market. Conley is a potential All-Star every year and available for a high price from the Grizzlies, but Jones noted above that he�s not looking to add someone very close to a decline that another team doesn�t think is part of their future.\nSo what WOULD the Suns do at the trade deadline? Would they do anything at all?\nMaybe. But don�t be surprised if the Suns let the trade deadline pass with nothing happening. They don�t want more draft picks, so you can�t expect them to trade Warren to a playoff contender for a low first round pick. And they won�t trade their developing young players for a 32+ year old veteran on the decline.\nAnd because of that, Jones doesn�t think he can make the team much better through a mid-season trade.\n�It�s very, very hard to project or to say that we�ll be able to add a player that fits with us long-term via trade,� Jones said. �It�s just not something teams are looking to do, where they�re looking to get rid of good players and help us grow.�\nThe swap of Ariza for impending restricted free agent Kelly Oubre Jr. is the only example we�ve seen so far of what kind of trade Jones will make, getting younger and potentially better long term in exchange for an aging vet on the decline.\nBut even the Oubre trade has downside. Oubre needs a new contract, and his cap hold this summer will already make it tough for the Suns to throw money around in free agency. I don�t see how the Suns would add yet another guy in that same position, potentially taking up the remaining space before free agency even starts.\nOpposing teams and agents keep trying to link the Suns to their disgruntled players, but Jones isn�t biting.\nLife under Jones is measured, and unlikely to produce blockbuster trades in the near future.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:30:18Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:41Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:30:18Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721030&p=4s5&v=1&x=CslYmwogR8oVNCN-P0BZLA","outboundUrls":["https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/phoenix-suns","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/98783/igor-kokoskov","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/257558/kelly-oubre-jr","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/285699/josh-jackson","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299928/deandre-ayton","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/257554/richaun-holmes","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/246307/t-j-warren","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/276611/dragan-bender","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/294259/quincy-acy","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299929/elie-okobo","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297012/jamal-crawford","http://arizonasports.com/story/1815649/with-trade-deadline-approaching-suns-not-pressing-to-do-anything/","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296564/trevor-ariza","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297218/jared-dudley","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297216/tyson-chandler","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/memphis-grizzlies","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/323702/t-j-warren","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296571/trevor-ariza","https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/295538/kelly-oubre-jr"],"wordCount":"972","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721030","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NTxkwCVjFgPUSk7YAJdzbpfBX4Q=/0x0:2080x1387/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/62929613/usa_today_11824957.0.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"WOUNDS & INJURIES","score":"89"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS & INJURIES","score":"70"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"SPORTS INJURIES","score":"74"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"CONTUSIONS","score":"70"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"BASKETBALL","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"INTERVIEWS","score":"68"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"PHOENIX, AZ, USA; UNITED STATES; ARIZONA, USA","score":"92"}],"companies":[],"locations":[{"name":"Portland","type":"city","mentions":"1","country":{"fipsCode":"US","isoCode":"us","name":"United States"},"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"Dallas","type":"city","mentions":"1","country":{"fipsCode":"US","isoCode":"us","name":"United States"},"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"}],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Quincy Acy"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Quincy Acy"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.919"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Igor Koko�kov"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Igor Kokoskov"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"James Jones"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"James Jones"},{"name":"instances","value":"11"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.746"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"�lie Okobo"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Elie Okobo"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.945"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"T.

Researchers attribute this to the dominance of industries like car manufacturing and mechanical engineering, which don't require much of a human touch.But I think the real explanation lies elsewhere. I think the robots are choosing to come here. In fact, I think what they really want is to avail of the country's excellent social security system.It's no wonder really. Since the time of Otto von Bismarck in the late 19 century, Germany has been fine-tuning an insurance system designed to protect workers from ill health, old age and, yes, thankfully for me � even redundancy.The proof is printed on my pay slip. Health insurance? Check. Unemployment insurance? Check. Long-term care insurance? Check. Statutory pension insurance? Check.No worriesThis is why, even as I face redundancy, I can maintain this bright and breezy tone.Next year, as my robot successor gets up at the crack of dawn for the early shift at the business desk, I'll be rolling over in bed, safe in the knowledge that I'll continue to receive 60 percent of my current salary without having to write a single column about the German economy.Robots know about these protections, so it's only natural that they're choosing to offer their skills to a country with a track record of enforcing those protections.The problem is that the system as it currently stands doesn't entirely meet their needs. If my robot replacement is to enjoy the peace of mind that I have had in the past, a number of reforms will be required.Health awarenessThe first tweak will be to health insurance. In the past, a sick human simply stayed at home watching Netflix and feeling sorry for themselves for a few days before returning to work. Sure, it made the company less productive for a while.But it wasn't a catastrophe. A robot infected by a virus, on the other hand, can destroy entire systems and potentially even bring down a firm. To guard against this threat, I propose the introduction of a so-called Anti-viral Insurance (AI) to be deducted at a rate of 20 percent from the robot's salary.The second major deduction will be for a beefed-up retirement insurance scheme. At present, humans who retire do so in the knowledge that their golden years in Portugal will be funded by their hardworking millennial grandchildren.Green energy compensation taxSadly, the same cannot be said of robots. Over the years, human reproduction has been sustained with very little or no intervention from the state. The process is remarkably cheap and doesn't require any electricity.To generate new robots, on the other hand, requires a huge amount of power, not all of which will be able to be provided by renewables. As Germany seeks to meet its climate change goals, it will be up to robots to foot the energy bill for their own reproduction. Based on my own estimates, I am proposing the green energy compensation tax to be set at 30 percent.Integrating millions of new robots into the German labor market presents further challenges. During the transition period, when people and robots work alongside each other, human interpreters will be needed to translate between German and the robots' native binary code.Lost in translation?At present, even much-lauded software like DeepL requires significant human intervention in order to meet workplace standards. To offset these additional personnel costs, a language tax of 15 percent will need to be imposed.Another challenge will be maintaining workplace harmony. Unfortunately, unlike most humans, robots don't come with a programmed ability to sense, understand and respond to the mood of their colleagues.While efforts to capture social intelligence in an algorithm continue, it will be necessary to guard against the possibility of embarrassing misunderstandings in the workplace. This so-called Faux Pas Insurance will follow the French model and be taxed at 35 percent.As you can see from my proposals, the new social security system will offer the next generation of robot workers absolute peace of mind. It will, of course, also leave them with no take-home pay.Not to worry! The scramble to sustain an entertaining yet informative column about the German economy offers more of a thrill than any amount of cash ever could.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:41Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721033&p=4s5&v=1&x=e4eWr5CbiwzrBmLHG3Mv3g","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"765","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

Gazastreifen will das Emirat das Geld nun �rtlichen \nHilfsprojekten geben. \"Wir hoffen, dass der Zuschuss als humanit�re Hilfe armen \nFamilien im Gazastreifen zugute kommt\", sagte der Vorsitzende des Katarischen \nKomitees zum Wiederaufbau Gazas, Mohamed el-Amadi, am Freitag. Die Verteilung \ndes Geldes werde mit den Vereinten Nationen koordiniert. \nZuvor hatte Israel die Zahlung erst gestoppt, aber dann doch erlaubt. \n\nDie im Gazastreifen herrschende Hamas hatte daraufhin Israel versuchte \nErpressung vorgeworfen und die Zahlung abgelehnt. Die radikal-islamische Hamas \nist die zweitgr��te Pal�stinenserorganisation. Die EU, Israel und die USA stufen \ndie Hamas als Terrororganisation ein. \n\nDie Zahlung der Gelder war als Teil einer im November ausgehandelten \nWaffenruhe zwischen Israel und der Hamas geplant. Mit dem Geld sollten Geh�lter \nvon Angestellten der Hamas bezahlt sowie arme Familien unterst�tzt werden. \n\nKatar hatte sich dazu bereiterkl�rt, innerhalb von sechs Monaten umgerechnet\nrund 132 Millionen Euro zu zahlen, um die Lebenssituation der Menschen in Gaza \nzu verbessern. \n\nDas kleine Golfemirat Katar gilt als au�enpolitisch hochambitioniert und \npflegt gute Kontakte mit einer gro�en Auswahl an Akteuren im Nahen Osten - unter \nanderem mit Gruppen, die der islamistischen Muslimbruderschaft nahe stehen oder \nwie die Hamas als Zweig der Muslimbruderschaft gegr�ndet wurden. Katar z�hlt zu \nden gro�z�gigsten finanziellen Unterst�tzern der Hamas. Au�erdem war das \nGolfemirat lange Jahre ein sicheres R�ckzugsgebiet f�r Hamas-F�hrer. Die Hamas \nunterhielt lange Zeit ihr Hauptquartier in Katar, bis die Hamas-F�hrer 2017 zur \nAusreise aufgefordert wurden. \n\nIsrael hat vor mehr als zehn Jahren eine Blockade �ber das K�stengebiet \nverh�ngt, die von �gypten mitgetragen wird.

Walker Am�rico  que faltasse vontade da Prefeitura em solucionar a quest�o e que desde 2016 o munic�pio tem investido mais nas viagens dos alunos. \n\nComo proposta, Walkinho sugeriu o afastamento da atual diretoria da Acep para que MP continue suas investiga��es sem prejudicar os estudantes. �Desde quando assumi a administra��o em 2017, comprometi-me com os estudantes e continuar com os repasses de combust�vel para ajudar nos custos dos alunos e a promessa foi cumprida. Todavia, recebemos recomenda��o do MP para n�o renovar conv�nio porque o MP est� investigando a atual diretoria da Acep. Como alternativa, para n�o prejudicar os alunos, propus que o atual presidente, Anderson Martins (Carioca), que alega n�o ter nenhuma irregularidade na Acep, se afaste at� que MP conclua esse inqu�rito e a Prefeitura possa manter o fornecimento de combust�vel�, ressalta. \n\nAnderson Martins  diz que n�o existe nenhuma irregularidade e ressaltou que o j� houve outras investiga��es que nunca apontaram nada contra a ACEP. Ele disse estar de acordo com a proposta j� que esta seria uma solu��o vi�vel para n�o prejudicar os estudantes. �N�o fizemos nada de errado e j� estamos entregando todas as documenta��es pedidas pelo MP e sentamos com o prefeito para discutir essa situa��o: se isso favorecer os alunos, � o que n�s est�vamos dispostos a fazer. Estamos encarando a situa��o da melhor forma poss�vel, porque nosso intuito enquanto diretoria e fazer o melhor que estiver ao nosso alcance para o estudante�, diz. \n\nPara a coordenadora da Secretaria Municipal de Ci�ncia e Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, respons�vel pelo controle e libera��o desse combust�vel a ACEP, Cristina Preto Oliveira Vasconcelos, foi uma reuni�o bastante positiva e caso a promotora respons�vel pelo caso aceite a proposta, isso pode beneficiar aos alunos. �J� que a ACEP est� sendo investigada, se ela aceitar isso e os alunos tamb�m, que s�o a parte interessada no caso e conhecem toda a din�mica � feita na Associa��o, acredito que � algo positivo e que pode dar certo�. \n\nAo final na reuni�o, estudantes de diferentes linhas que viajam para cidades da regi�o se apresentaram como volunt�rios. Entre eles foram escolhidos como membros da Diretoria Executiva da ACEP os estudantes Weslley Dias Oliveira, Isabela de Oliveira Vieira e Cau� M�rcio Rodrigues David. A comiss�o de acompanhamento foi composta pelos estudantes Luciano Donizete Machado, Gustavo Rodrigues Vilela, Liriane Vita Pereira Nortes, Anderson Expedito Vieira e Luana Clara Firmo Souza. \n\nConforme Weslley Oliveira, a principio estudantes estavam bastante desesperados j� que as aulas est�o prestes a come�ar . �A proposta do prefeito, j� que at� ent�o ningu�m tinha pensado em nada, ser� de grande valia para os alunos. � uma comiss�o tempor�ria e se der certo ser� bom para todos n�s�, destaca. O estudante salienta ainda que os estudantes t�m estado h� algum tempo insatisfeitos com a ACEP e que esta nova comiss�o ser� ben�fica, tendo em vista o tempo de atua��o do atual presidente da Associa��o. \n\nUma reuni�o deve ser convoca com o Minist�rio P�blico para apresentar a alternativa e se acatada pela 5� Promotoria a Prefeitura deve retomar os repasses de combust�vel � ACEP. Segundo o presidente da Comiss�o de Educa��o e Sa�de, Vin�cius Scarano, a sugest�o foi muito v�lida, mas ainda precisa ser levada ao conhecimento da promotora. �Por�m, s� ter� efeito se a 5� Promotoria aceitar, o que se acontecer, j� na pr�xima semana acreditamos que tudo estar� resolvido�, completa.","tags":[],"harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:41Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:41Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721037&p=4s5&v=1&x=3xU_-_Efv1iF71PZKDgTAA","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"743","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350028694","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://jornaldosudoeste.com.br/assets/img/noticia/cd721208d166d3bad19a96a3e219ce5780a.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Teaching

These amendments are expected to come into force in the summer of 2019.Gowling WLG FocusIn December 2017, the provincial and federal Finance Ministers in Canada agreed to pursue legislative amendments to ensure corporations hold accurate and up to date information on beneficial owners. The objective was to \"prevent the misuse of corporations and other legal entities for tax evasion and other criminal purposes, such as money laundering, corruption and the financing of terrorist activities.\"1 The federal government is the first to enact legislation to address these concerns.Changes coming to the CBCAOn December 13, 2018, Bill C-86[1] received royal assent. This Bill contains a series of amendments to the CBCA pertaining to the tracking and recording of \"individuals with significant control\" (\"ISCs\") over a corporation.An ISC is defined as an individual who (i) is a registered or beneficial owner of, or (ii) has direct or indirect control over, a significant number of shares of the corporation. A significant number of shares is defined as (i) 25% or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation measured by fair market value or (ii) 25% or more of the voting rights attached to all of the corporation's outstanding shares.In addition, an ISC includes any individual who has any direct or indirect influence that, if exercised, would result in control in fact of the corporation. This could take a variety of forms and would include:each individual who, jointly with one or more other individuals, holds shares meeting the \"significant number of shares\" threshold;each individual who, by an agreement to act together with one or more other individuals, jointly meets the \"significant number of shares\" threshold; andindividuals with the right to nominate or remove a majority of the board of directors (whether shareholders or not).These examples are not an exhaustive list and it will be a question of fact in each case whether an individual has the necessary control or influence to be an ISC.What this means for your corporationNew ISC Register. Certain CBCA corporations will be required to keep a register of ISCs which contains the following information with respect to each ISC:their name, date of birth, and latest address;jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes;the day when they became or ceased to be an ISC;a description of how they have significant control;any other \"prescribed information\".These provisions only apply to private corporations. Reporting issuers, corporations listed on a designated stock exchange and corporations of a \"prescribed class\" are not required to comply.The regulations have not yet been made public, so the meaning of \"prescribed information,\" and \"prescribed class\" have yet to be defined.Active investigation and inquiry. At least once during each financial year of the corporation, a CBCA corporation must take reasonable steps to ensure that it has identified all ISCs and that the register is up to date. Further, if at any time, a CBCA corporation becomes aware of relevant information pertaining to a new or existing ISC, they will have a period of 15 days to record that information. The ISC register must include a description of the steps the corporation has taken to comply with these requirements.Access. While the amendments do not make the ISC register available to the public, the information in the ISC register is available to all shareholders and creditors of a corporation who provide the corporation with an affidavit confirming that they will only use the information in connection with matters relating to the affairs of the corporation.A CBCA corporation must also provide the information from the ISC register to the Canadian government upon request.Non-Compliance. It remains to be seen how compliance will be audited, but the consequences of non-compliance are clear: every director, officer or shareholder who knowingly acts in contravention of these duties will be liable to a fine of up to $200,000, or up to six months imprisonment, or both.Considering the gravity of the consequences for non-compliance, CBCA corporations should make these requirements known to their shareholders and implement new protocols in their annual and ongoing reporting procedures to ensure that they are not caught unaware when the amendments come into force in the summer of 2019.While the proposed amendments only currently apply to federally incorporated corporations, given the agreement of all Finance Ministers to pursue this type of legislation, it can be expected that that the provinces will soon follow suit.Footnotes1 Agreement to Strengthen Beneficial Ownership Transparency at https://www.fin.gc.ca/n17/data/17-122_4-eng.asp[2]Read the original article on GowlingWLG.com[3]The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

So why do Florida textbook contracts go out and get signed for five years? Smaller publishers increasingly wonder how to compete with the biggest names in the business so long as long-term bids remain the norm in the Sunshine State. 'It absolutely hinders innovation,' said Michael B. Horn, chief strategic officer for Entangled Solutions[1]. Yet for decades, the textbook game nationwide produced 5-, 6- or even 9-year contracts on a regular basis. That's started to change as states like Texas re-evaluate long-term arrangements[2] with major vendors. But in Florida, school districts work with the Florida Department Of Education to set up five-year relationships on textbooks and many other educational supplements. https://www.fpl.com/innovation'It's time for Florida's education policy to adapt to modern times,' said Rita Ferrandino, founding partner for Arc Capital Development. That could be slow-moving on the biggest contracts for textbooks, but already some of Florida's individual school districts have started to employ different strategies on supplementary materials like software. Sylvia Diaz, assistant superintendent for schools orMiami-Dade County Public Schools[3], said her district has been on a mission to employ more cutting-edge technology in the classroom. That means dispatching hardware like the 150,000 mobile devices in the hands of district students. It also means using tools like Curriculum Associates' i-Ready software to empower teachers and prepare kids[4] for rigorous academic standards.https://www.forthepeople.com/?utm_source=orlando-rising..._medium=banner'A lot of strategies across different programs in the school district have contributed to the district's success,' she said. She said the district still adopts textbooks through the standard state system, which provides for five-year pricing and bundling of materials. These days, many textbook publishers will provide accompanying software with a web component that allows for upgrades and improvements. But the district remains bound to five-year deals when working through the state. But in addition to those deals, Miami-Dade officials also enter other contracts funded with local revenues to do business with publishers of additional materials. 'We don't have to go into five-year contracts with supplements like i-Ready,' explained Lisette Alves, Assistant Superintendent of Academics for the Miami-Dade district. Rather, those deals are locally funded and negotiated as pilot programs. The longest such contracts typically run for three years, and allow for to district to opt out each year if officials find a more effective education delivery system. And that's actually what many smaller publishers prefer. While everyone enjoys having a contract promising to sustain and enrich a company for years, the truth of long-term contracts is they favor mega-corporations. And those companies aren't always the ones on the bleeding edge of innovation. Long-term publishing deals date back decades to when the only significant materials being purchased by schools from publishers were textbooks. And for subject matters like mathematics, foreign language and history, there seemed little change in the curricula over five-year periods. Why swap out books more frequently than necessary? That's not so true in a world of software upgrades. New classroom management techniques quickly work themselves into education supplements. And the capacity of programs changes rapidly. Consider the look of mobile phone games released in 2014 and what differs from anything released this year. 'In the age of digital technology tools, a five-year commitment no longer meets the needs of the students,' said Ferrandino. 'Can you imagine your kids taking what they were using five years ago and then using it now?' Meanwhile, textbooks from some major providers haven't kept up with national standards and shifts in curricula. EdReports.org[5] notes, for example, that Pearson Literature materials for high school grade levels only partially meet the expectations of tests on the subjects. Yet, they continue to be adopted by state schools. And those digital supplements? Edweek[6]reports Pearson was selling off much of those materials as it focused on its most profitable contracts, leaving many educators worried about whether those tools will soon disappear. So why do districts continue to buy from the publisher? It's easier in many cases to stick withlegacy offerings that regulators and school district officials already know. Ferrandino worked for 20 years for Pearson[7], one of the biggest names in textbook publishing. But for the past 15 years, she has worked through her capital group instead with startup and small business providers of educational materials. She sees long-term deals with publishers only benefitting the established industry players. 'It's the big dogs that want to lock it all in, and that's not typically where we have seen innovation,' she said. Florida can already be a hard state to do business because so many of the districts here are so massive, and to do work at the statewide level means needing the capacity to serve the third most populous state in the union. But five-year contracts limit opportunities even more, Ferrandino said. Horn said the infrequency in opportunities to even pursue new contracts has an impact on the how hard companies work to stay ahead of the curve. 'It hinders the velocity to solicit new providers and try things out,' he said. And districts may be more reticent to work with startups that may not be around five years from now. Any new business has an inherently risky future, after all. 'It protects the incumbent,' Horn said. 'Anytime you are prescribing precisely how a local school district will operate with a vendor, you are restricting innovation.' And not every district enjoys the freedom Miami-Dade has to go it alone. Florida's most populous county has a $26 million budget for textbook contracts negotiated through the Department of Education, and can spend millions more on side contracts. But smaller districts lack such ability. It begs the question, do Florida's current procurement standards allow for creativity and innovation at all? 'It doesn't result in the best education tools being sold by companies,' Ferrandino said. Horn said Florida districts need more ability to set up contracts that don't bring long-term commitments. 'If new providers come to the market, districts need flexibility,' he said. 'That's what you need in any organization if you are going to succeed.'

The development scheme originally included the creation of 18 timeshare apartments alongside a communal club house and additional recreational facilities including an outdoor heated swimming pool, tennis and squash courts and an 18-hole golf course.Following the early success of the Mansion House development, Gulf Investments created a second timeshare development on adjacent land they had recently acquired (\"Elham House\"). Elham House was transferred as a freehold to Elham House Development Ltd, another member of the Gulf Group, on 11 November 1981. Elham House was subsequently transferred to the members of the Regency Villas Owners Club (\"RVOC\"). The 1981 Transfer included the following grant of rights:\"the right for the Transferee its successors in title its lessees and the occupiers from time to time of the property to use the swimming pool, golf course, squash courts, tennis courts, the ground and basement floor of the Broome Park Mansion House, gardens and any other sporting or recreational facilities (hereafter called 'the facilities') on the Transferor's adjoining estate.\"The promoters of the leisure complex in the Park envisaged that it would attract sufficient paying members of the public (aside from the timeshare residents) to fund its ongoing operating costs. However, this did not materialise and starting in 1983, from time to time, members of the RVOC made voluntary payments on behalf of timeshare owners to the owners and operators of the Park towards the costs, including upkeep, of the facilities. They made these voluntary payments under a reservation of rights and any individual timeshare owners that were charged fees for the use of specific facilities, paid them notwithstanding their case that they were entitled to the use of those facilities free of charge.First instanceThe timeshare owners claimed a declaration that they were entitled, by way of easement, to the free use of all the sporting or recreational facilities from time to time provided within the Park, and an injunction restraining interference with them by the Defendants (the current freehold and leasehold owners of the Park). The timeshare owners also sought the return of sums paid by them or on their behalf by the RVOC for the use of those facilities since 2008, as damages for interference with their easement, or by way of restitution.At the trial before the late Judge Purle QC sitting as a High Court judge in 2015, the timeshare owners succeeded in all their claims, save only for the recovery of payments made for the use of facilities before 2012, which the judge held had been made by agreement rather than under protest. The timeshare owners were held to have a right to use all of the sporting and recreational facilities, even where such facilities had not yet been built at the time of transfer.Court of AppealIn the Court of Appeal, the timeshare owners were successful again on the main issue about whether the rights over the facilities granted by the 1981 Transfer constituted an easement or easements. However, the court held that the timeshare owners did not have any rights in relation to the new swimming pool which did not exist at the time of transfer. The Court of Appeal also excluded rights in relation to anything provided on the ground floor and basement of the Mansion House.The Defendants appealed the contention that the 1981 Transfer granted no enduring rights in the nature of easements in relation to any of the facilities within the Park. The timeshare owners cross-appealed and sought to restore the trial judge's conclusion that they had a right in relation to all of the facilities, including the new swimming pool.Supreme CourtThe Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of the Defendants and granted the timeshare owners' cross-appeal in respect of the new swimming pool and, in doing so, affirmed the decision in re Ellenborough Park, the leading case on the conditions for the recognition of a right as an easement. These are as follows:There must be a dominant and a servient tenement;The easement must accommodate the dominant tenement;The dominant and servient owners must be different persons; andA right over land cannot amount to an easement, unless it is capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant.Lord Briggs held that:\"The grant of purely recreational (including sporting) rights over land which genuinely accommodate adjacent land may be the subject matter of an easement, provided always that they satisfy the four well-settled conditions... Where the actual or intended use of the dominant tenement is itself recreational, as will generally be the case for holiday timeshare developments, the accommodation condition will generally be satisfied. Whether the other conditions, and in particular the components of the fourth condition, will be satisfied will be a question of fact in each case. Whatever may have been the attitude in the past to \"mere recreation or amusement\", recreational and sporting activity of the type exemplified by the facilities at Broome Park is so clearly a beneficial part of modern life that the common law should support structures which promote and encourage it, rather than treat it as devoid of practical utility or benefit\".The trial judge's interpretation that the 1981 Transfer constituted a single easement was preferred to the Court of Appeal's interpretation.CommentThis judgment is significant in that it recognises a new 'species' of easement. It illustrates that the common law can adapt to new types of property ownership and new ways of enjoying the use of land (in this case a timeshare development). Property owners and developers of mixed-use complexes should be aware that sporting and recreational activity can be the subject matter of an easement and be conscious not to expressly or inadvertently grant such a right unless they are willing to take the financial risk of maintaining such facilities without the contribution from those who can make use of them as of right.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - January 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Protest auf dem Prinzipalmarkt: 50 Sch�ler halten Mahnwache f�r mehr Klimaschutz","content":"M�nster - \n \nNachdem am vergangenen Freitag 800 Sch�ler unter dem Titel �Fridays for Future� vor dem historischen Rathaus f�r eine konsequentere Klimapolitik demonstriert hatten, versammelten sich am Freitag nach Polizeiangaben rund 50 Klimasch�tzer auf dem Prinzipalmarkt, um mit einer Mahnwache an ihre Forderungen zu erinnern. \n   Freitag, 25.01.2019, 15:57 Uhr       \n\"Das Motto lautet: Wir streiken bis ihr handelt\", erkl�rte die Versammlungsleiterin der Mahnwache, Eva Kintrup , den Grund, weshalb die Aktivisten auch nach der gro�en Demo weiter f�r ihr Anliegen auf die Stra�e gehen. Sie forderten sofort wirksame Klimaschutzgesetze. \"Wirksam f�rs Klima, nicht f�r die Wirtschaft\", erg�nzte Kintrup.  \n \nDie Organisatorin der ersten Demo, Carla Reemtsma , war anl�sslich der letzten Sitzung der Kohlekommission zeitgleich in Berlin. Dort diskutierte sie w�hrend eines Treffens mit Bundeswirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier (CDU). �Er sagte, man m�sse die Wirtschaft im Blick haben und dass er sein Bestes f�r den Klimaschutz gebe. Wir finden, dass er noch mehr geben kann�, sagte Reemtsma im Telefonat mit unserer Zeitung. \n    Der Tweet wird geladen    \nAu�erdem �bergab sie zusammen mit einer Aktivisten-Delegation einen Brief Vertretern der Kohlekommission und ging nachher mit Tausenden zusammen auf die Stra�e demonstrieren.

Sure, the fans will always be there ready and willing for a debate, but for most of us, there�s little difference between using Windows or macOS. Most of our day-to-day computing is happening in a web browser�and those are pretty universal at this point. The really popular apps we might use, like Spotify, Slack, or Photoshop, are cross-platform too. But it really does matter which OS you use, and not just because there might be a learning curve if you make a switch. Here are some of the key reasons why your choice still counts. \n\nBundled software \n\nThere�s no doubt macOS has the edge when it comes to the software you get with your operating system. Mail, Safari, Apple Maps, Messages, FaceTime, iTunes and the rest. Admittedly Pages, Numbers, and KeyNote can�t match Microsoft Office in terms of features and power, but they�re more than enough for most people�and completely free. \n\nThen you�ve got iMovie for movie making and GarageBand for music making for free as well, neither of which have Windows equivalents, and you can see why macOS is the operating system to pick if you want most software out of the box. You might well never need to install another application. \n\nOver on the Windows side of the fence, you do get basic email, calendar, and contacts clients as part of Windows 10, but that�s about it. Skype and Microsoft Edge are included too, and you get simple tools for photo, music, and movie management, but some of our favorite apps, like Windows Movie Maker, are no more, and Windows Media Player is woefully neglected. \n\nThere�s a wealth of third-party Windows software out there�much of it free�but in terms of what you get with the operating system, it�s dragging behind what Apple offers with macOS. Microsoft can console itself with the knowledge that it makes the better office suite (for both Windows and macOS), but then again you will have to pay for it. \n\nWhy it matters: Apple has a wider variety of high-quality software built in�which could save you money. \n\nGaming and VR \n\nFrom a macOS slam-dunk to a Windows slam-dunk: Microsoft�s operating system is the place to be if you�re interested in gaming or virtual reality. While the HTC Vive headsets can now work with macOS Mojave, the same can�t be said of the Oculus Rift, and the Windows Mixed Reality headsets are, as you�d expect, Windows only. If you�ve got an Xbox, a Windows 10 computer is the perfect companion too. \n\nGaming support isn�t non-existent on the Mac platform, but it�s a long, long way behind what you get on Windows, which has top-tier titles, support for a much bigger range of Steam games, and so forth. Most Macs don�t come with a discrete graphics card (though external GPUs are supported), which means a lot of macOS machines just aren�t ready for serious gaming out of the box. \n\nOn Windows, the gaming scene is as busy and vibrant as it�s ever been. Because that�s where the players are, that�s where you�ll find the biggest choice of gaming accessories, utilities, and add-ons as well. And, of course, if you want to build your own gaming rig, you�re going to have to use Windows. \n\nApple has made moves to improve gaming and VR support for macOS, but it�s looking like a lost cause at the moment, with little interest from third-party developers and manufacturers. Apple will have to content itself with dominating the gaming scene on mobile devices instead. \n\nWhy it matters: Windows has the superior support for VR and gaming, and can even replace a gaming console, saving you money. But a Mac, even a powerful one, for gaming, is throwing that money away. \n\nLook and feel \n\nThis is perhaps the most subjective part of the comparison: Windows has now become slick and polished enough to be almost as easy on the eye as macOS, and which one you prefer really comes down to personal choice. It�s probably going to be the one you�ve spent most of your time using in the past. \n\nSpeaking as someone who uses both macOS and Windows every day, I find Windows easier to get around�but that�s probably because it�s the one I�ve been using for longer. File Explorer in Windows seems a lot more intuitive and capable than Finder, but then I have had several extra years to learn the shortcuts and the necessary techniques. \n\nEven when it comes to windows management�more regimented on Windows, more free and easy on macOS�you�re likely to have your own preference that you�ve just got used to. What differences there are, whether it�s Siri vs Cortana or the dock vs the Start menu, they�re not really going to have an impact on your productivity. \n\nBoth Apple and Microsoft have borrowed enough from each other over the last five-to-ten years (hello dark mode) that there are no big gaps here. I like the way windows can be snapped to the screen edge on Windows, and the way desktop icons can be automatically organized on macOS, but we�re talking minor rather than major differences. \n\nWhy it matters: The UI is actually the one place where it doesn�t matter! Apple and Microsoft have both done a good job creating attractive and pretty easy to use systems. Though you�ll have an easier time using the one you�re more familiar with. \n\nThe wider ecosystem \n\nNow, here�s the rub�like a lot of your other tech choices nowadays, you�re not so much choosing between Windows and macOS as choosing something that�s going to work with what you�ve already got set up. That includes other devices as well as other services like iCloud, OneDrive, or Google Drive. \n\nYou can use iPhones with Windows and Android phones with macOS, but your life is going to be a lot easier if you stick to everything by Apple or stick to the alternatives. If you�ve got an Apple TV set up in the living room then you�re only going to be able to beam audio to it from Windows�not video; on macOS, you can use AirPlay to send audio and video, and to mirror your screen. \n\nIf you live your life on an iPhone then all your calendars, contacts, notes and everything else are going to sync magically to macOS. You can sync to Windows too, but it�s more difficult to do and requires jumping through more hoops. If you live a multi-platform life the best option is perhaps to eschew Microsoft and Apple services completely and get Google to do all the cloud stuff instead. Both Windows and macOS support it quite nicely�though on Windows 10 you also have the added benefit of being able to respond to text messages from your Android phone on your computer. \n\nApple�s ecosystem, which is tied down to Apple itself, or pricey partners, feel small by comparison. Yet the AirPlay-on-TVs deals we saw at CES and support for AirPlay on Sonos speakers seem like signs that Apple is looking to take a few bricks out of the wall around its garden going forward. That said, it�s fair to say Windows works with a bigger variety of kit than macOS does. If you don�t want to have everything you own crafted by a single company than Windows is for you. \n\nWhy it matters: Apple�s more closed off ecosystem just works, but also restricts you to expensive Apple products and partners. Windows might not work as well with Apple products, but it tends to work for better with everything else. \n\nSecurity and privacy \n\nWhen it comes to security and privacy it�s no contest. Apple wins. It has an aggressive approach to user privacy and benefits from the fact that most of the world�s malware takes aim at Windows�which might be because of Windows� much larger market share more than anything else. You�re statistically safer on macOS, though not completely invulnerable. \n\nThe gap isn�t a huge one though. The days of Windows being a virus riddled mess if you used it without anti-virus software are thankfully behind us. Provided you�re running the very latest version of Windows 10 (complete with its built-in Windows Defender anti-malware tool) then you�re pretty well patched against major threats. The biggest security disasters usually affect older versions of Windows or are nothing to do with the OS at all. \n\nIn terms of what apps can do on your system, both Windows and macOS let you control which programs can access your microphone, camera, current location, and so on. It�s fair to say that Windows users probably need to be a little more security savvy than macOS users, and Windows certainly gives users (and app developers) more freedom when it comes to the risks they can take. \n\nAs for privacy, we�re giving the nod (just barely!) to Apple, because it makes a lot of noise about wanting to protect users. Check out the privacy policies for Apple and Microsoft though, and again there isn�t a massive difference in how data is used, even if Apple relies more on local storage than the cloud�users are far more likely to be worried about the likes of Google and Facebook instead. \n\nWhy it matters: Apple�s hard line on privacy means you�re less likely to find your photos and data out in the wild. Windows has dramatically improved over the years, but you�ll still want to be well versed in privacy and security to use it as safely as you can a Mac. \n\nValue for money \n\nWhen it comes to the best value for your money Windows has traditionally had the edge and it remains the case: You�re not going to be able to pick up a $300 laptop running macOS. For students, casual users, and just about anyone on a budget, a cheap Windows machine makes more sense�especially when you consider our earlier point about a lot of modern-day computing being done through the web browser. \n\nAdmittedly many people are happy to pay extra for the Apple premium. Anecdotally, we�ve noticed Macs lasting longer than Windows machines before becoming too old and slow to be unusable, though you could probably put that at the door of the hardware manufacturers rather than Windows itself, which has actually slimmed down in recent years. \n\nAnd speaking of manufacturers, Windows is available on a lot more different types of laptop, desktop, and 2-in-1. You don�t have to stick to the Mac designs that Apple puts out, because you can choose from a Surface Pro or a Dell XPS laptop or a Lenovo all-in-one. That has advantages and disadvantages, but it definitely means more choice. \n\nComing from someone who spends a lot of time in both Windows and macOS, both of them offer a polished, secure, fast and intuitive experience�it�s difficult to say one is particularly better than the other for every person in every situation, but that doesn�t mean there aren�t big differences to consider. \n\nWhy it matters: Windows has a wider variety of hardware at a wider variety of price points. It�s simply cheaper, and for a lot of people cost trumps all�including Apple�s well-design hardware.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:49Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721917&p=4s5&v=1&x=ndwQnx1QCwxDXHn48-gs7Q","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"1847","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721917","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"Apple

is not recovering easily amid downside pressures","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Forex Crunch: http://forexcrunch.com Delivered by Newstex)  EUR/USD is trying to recover after suffering from USD strength. A light calendar allows sentiment to make its mark. The technical picture is bearish for the pair.EUR/USD stabilizes above 1.3000 after dipping below the round number late on Thursday in a volatile session. However, the move up from the lows is a 'dead cat bounce' and does not look like a real recovery. The European Central Bank left its policies unchanged as expected, and PresidentMario Draghi[1]conveyed a balanced message. On the one hand, theECB[2]acknowledged the downturn and provided a long list of issues, mostly external. On the other hand, the Frankfurt-based institution is encouraged by a tighter labor market and rising wages. The big question for the central bank is a question of confidence. If the long list of one-off factors makes way, the economic situation could improve. However, the long-lasting slowdown can affect morale and turn into a deeper rout. Policymakers gave themselves more time to assess the situation, waiting until their March meeting, when new forecasts are due. See:ECB Quick Analysis: Euro rises on Draghi's balancing act, but beware the ides of March[3] EUR/USD initially dropped, then rose with Draghi's balanced message, and fell after the press conference. The drop can be attributed to reports that the German government is set to slash growth forecasts to only 1% in 2019. The continent's largest economy has flirted with a recession. The German IFO Business Climate for January is projected to drop from 101 reported in December. Euro/dollar also dropped due to a bout of US Dollar strength. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that China and the US are 'miles away' in trade talks. His words did not help sentiment. Also, the Senate failed to approve motions that would reopen the government. The shutdown is taking its toll on the economy as 800,000 workers are set to miss another paycheck. The shutdown also takes its toll on economic publications. Durable Goods Orders that were due today are off. The light calendar leaves markets to move on sentiment related to the prospects of the European economies, the shutdown, US-Chinese talks and also Brexit. Hopes for a softer Brexit were joined by reports that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) on which the government relies is warming up towards supporting May's deal. The tickingclock and the fear of no Brexit at all are likely behind their potential change of tack. All in all, the prospects of a no-deal, hard Brexit, boost the pound throughout the week and the euro may enjoy these developments. Several euro-zone economies are also set to suffer in case of a disruptive British exit from the EU.EUR/USD Technical Analysishttps://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart-interactive?asset=eurusd EUR/USD[4]remains on the back foot despite the bounce. Momentum is to the downside, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 30, not in oversold territory. Initial support awaits at 1.1310, the initial swing low for 2019. The fresh yearly low at 1.1290 recorded on Thursday is the next level to watch. Further down, 1.1270 was a double-bottom in December. The 2018 trough of 1.1215 is next. 1.1330 was the recent high. 1.1350 worked as support in mid-January. 1.1390 capped the pair on Thursday, and 1.1410 held it down last week.Get the 5 most predictable

Every culture has it. So matter where we are from we can connect to people through this food,� said 25-year-old Biubiu Xu, the founder of the pop-up, which first made its debut in New York with a three-month run that attracted 60,000 visitors before it headed to Shanghai.\n\nThe L.A. location is four times the size of the New York pop-up.\n\nSo what�s the Egg House? It�s not a house made of eggs � that wouldn�t go over easy with building inspectors � but rather an installation that includes 15 scenes showing recreations of the city�s most iconic places surrounded by colorful egg-inspired imagery and food.\n\nIt follows a fictional character named Ellis, an egg who dreams of having fancy houses and adventurous trips, and this pop-up is his journey through L.A.\n\nWhile Xu didn�t want to give away too many details away about what exactly people will see at the Egg House, you can expect to find a 750-square-foot pink and blue basketball court that represents Staples Center, a beach scene illustrating the Santa Monica Pier that includes a pool of colorful balls representing the ocean plus a miniature room with tiny tableware representing a perfect L.A. brunch where eggs are the main ingredient. Besides the city scenes there will be egg-inspired snacks available for visitors.\n\nInstead of hard-boiled or deviled eggs, think lollipops, chocolates, macarons and mochi ice cream shaped like eggs.\n\n�It will be a great place to explore in person and take photos,� Xi said.\n\nIn the New York Egg House, selfie lovers scrambled to post pictures with things like a giant egg carton with eggs inside as well as an egg ball pool, egg chairs, giant eggs and an egg-shaped swing.\n\nThe Egg House follows similar selfie-driven pop-up art installations such as the Museum of Ice Cream and it also comes at a time when eggs are hotter than ever.\n\nCurrently an egg, just a plain old egg, is the most liked post on Instagram ever, with more than 50 million �likes� as of mid-January this year. \n\nIt beat out former Instagram world record holder Kylie Jenner, who had 18 million likes on her baby announcement post.\n\nIt�s an egg-citing time for this old food. If You Go: When: February-April, no exact dates yet.\n\nWhere: 1001 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.\n\nAdmission: Ticket prices and sale date not yet set but expected to go on sale this month\n\nInformation: www.theegghouse.com and on Instagram at

Upon Kaizen: My Online Meeting Scheduling System","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Lean Blog: https://www.leanblog.org Delivered by Newstex)  http://measuresofsuccessbook.com Reminder: Today is the last day to enter the giveaway contest that's giving away a set of two books: My book MeasuresofSuccess[1] and Jeff Hunter's book Patient-CenteredStrategy[2].�Click here to enter[3]. A key Kaizen principle is continually improving through incremental improvements. When we use a Kaizen process to improve our work, we're not likely to make things perfect � just better. One Kaizen often leads to another, as we get positive reinforcement from each small improvement. We see benefits, we feel better, so we do more improvement. We get closer to our target. Toyota Kata is a similar mindset � one experiment after another, with learning and improvement taking place. In 2017, I blogged about my improvements to my meeting / phone call scheduling process:This system continues to work well. I still get positive comments and 'thumbs up' from people when we start a call that has been scheduled this way. But, nothing is ever perfect. And that's OK. One thing I have tweaked over time is using the YouCanBook.me system 'buffer' in between meetings. There's nothing worse than meetings that run back-to-back (or back-to-back-to-back) with no time in between. It often means rushing off one call into another � sometimes that means cutting off a discussion with a client that could have run a few minutes over to everybody's benefit. Sometimes, it meant being a bit late to the next call, which I hate doing. So, I had added a 15-minute buffer between meetings. If a meeting was already on the calendar from 1 pm to 2 pm, the next one couldn't be scheduled until 2:15 pm. I had a catch-up call scheduled recently with a former colleague and long-time friend. He scheduled it for 2:15. 2:15 came and went and I didn't hear from him. Then, he apologized and realized he had missed the call. He told me:'I glanced at my calendar and thought the call was starting at 2:30. I never have meetings that start at :15 or :45.'Ah, great point. That made me reflect I've made that error before (or maybe it was a near miss). So, my Kaizen improvement is to adjust the buffer to 30 minutes instead of 15. This generally means that calls or meetings will more likely start at the top or bottom of the hour. Somebody can still choose to start a meeting at :15 or :45, but I bet this change will minimize that. My hypothesis is that things will work better but all I can do is try and see. The other possible change I could make is to tweak the calendar to allow meetings to be scheduled in 30-minute increments instead of 15 but sometimes, a 15-minute is all that's needed.

on economic diplomacy positions #Kazakhstan well to attract investment in times of growing competition","content":"Jan 25, 2019( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  In today's highly competitive global environment, economic and trade ties are an increasingly important part of international diplomacy. Nowadays, official government visits focus not only on international political issues, but also on developing closer economic cooperation, encouraging investment and promoting exports. Embassies deal with diplomatic and consular issues and also increasingly engage with foreign investors, businesses, and trade organizations.President Nursultan Nazarbayev was, therefore, right to task the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attract high quality foreign direct investment to Kazakhstan. Under the ministry's expanded remit, it will be responsible not just for attracting FDI but also for promoting the export of the country's products around the world. These changes make sense. As President Nazarbayev noted, the foreign ministry's staff speak numerous languages and know the countries of their missions' presence well. Perhaps, most importantly, the ministry has the ability to conduct economic diplomacy through embassies and foreign missions across the globe. The newly appointed Foreign Minister Beibut Atamkulov is the right person to lead this important change. He has dedicated most of his career to the economic success of Kazakhstan. His decades of professional experience, working closely with foreign businesses, will give the MFA the economic vision and leadership it needs to meet this important challenge. Each year the foreign ministry and its global diplomats help to organize more than 300 trade, economic and investment events and approximately 600 foreign delegation visits to Kazakhstan and vice versa. Such engagements have already facilitated an increase in foreign direct investment and the President's most recent changes will provide even greater impetus. Building upon this, major achievements were made in 2018 in the sphere of economic diplomacy. This included implementing agreements reached by President Nazarbayev during foreign visits and promoting the transit and transport potential of Kazakhstan through the Nurly Zhol programme, which enables major investment in Kazakhstan's infrastructure, as well as in conjunction with China's Belt and Road Initiative. These will remain important priorities for 2019, in addition to supporting Kazakhstan's domestic companies and developing the tourism industry (the foreign ministry is directly involved in helping implement the state programme for tourism). Enabling foreign direct investment, promoting exports, as well as contributing to the development of the Eurasian Economic Union, are also among other important priorities. When it comes to securing foreign investment, Kazakhstan has attracted more than 300 billion dollars in FDI since independence, making the country the leading investment destination in Central Asia. Over the past two years alone, foreign investors have invested over 20 billion dollars annually in Kazakhstan's economy. However, attracting high-quality investment is becoming even more competitive, with many countries around the world vying for the same foreign business and reliable sources of capital. For this reason, it is important for Kazakhstan to continually adapt to new global realities and stay ahead of the curve. As a Kazakh deputy foreign minister noted during a recent interview, 'As we seek to further modernize our economy in order to reach our goal of joining the top 30 most developed countries by 2050, we naturally need to strengthen our efforts to attract a diversified range of foreign investments and technologies.' The foreign ministry will now oversee the work of the Committee for Investment, as well as the work of Kazakh Invest, the national company tasked with attracting FDI to Kazakhstan. This expanded remit will give the foreign ministry the additional capabilities and resources needed to deliver for Kazakhstan and its people. Placing economic diplomacy under the remit of the foreign ministry, an organisation with extensive international experience, is a positive and forward-thinking decision. It will help to safeguard Kazakhstan's economic future and have a clear impact on our country's ability to attract foreign investment and promote the exports of a diverse range of national products. In a highly competitive global environment, this move will ensure Kazakhstan can remain the top investment destination in Central Asia and an economic powerhouse in the wider region.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:46Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721587&p=4s5&v=1&x=cgqfWD5_xBGHM55UW63cnQ","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"755","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

In 2015, a complainant charged that Daniels had properties beyond those listed in her financial disclosure forms. In September, the commission found probable cause. At issue: alleged omitted disclosures on 2012-2014 financial disclosure forms, including mortgages for properties that belonged to her church, adding up to $1,000,000 of undeclared assets. Indeed, her churches had multiple properties � 'parsonages' � in various cities, timeshares, and over a dozen cars. http://www.flmedical.org/Index.aspxA conflation of assets between Daniels and her Spoken Word Ministries led to a confusing trail of which properties were owned by which entity. When Daniels divorced, she and her formerhusband divided profits from a house registered to SWM. A report by Ethics Commission advocateMelody Hadleydescribed the situation as 'interesting.' Also at issue: timeshares with the Daniels' names on the deeds, along with that of the ministry, another conflation of ownership interest. A stipulation in the agreement between Ethics and Daniels is that the matter will be referred to House SpeakerJose Oliva for disciplinary determination. Asimilar complaint[2]filed previously was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, as it was listed within 30 days of Jacksonville's 2015 election.http://www.mhdfirm.com/Daniels was re-elected in the Democratic primary in August, defeating Duval County School Board chairPaula Wrightdespite the local party leaning in favor of Wright's campaign. As there were no GOP or NPA candidates, the open primary was decisive. Last year, the Florida Chamber recognized Daniels as the most pro-business Democrat in state government. Additionally, she is known for bills that many critics say blur the lines between church and state, including a 2019 proposal[3] to require high schools to offer Bible study courses as an elective.

She said the image, which shows the United States as Death, wielding a scythe bearing the flag of Israel and drawing blood in four separate continents, as painting 'a thousand words.' Initially she bizarrely blamed her tweet on her phone running out of batteryDespite calls for an apology last night it took until late this morning for Womack to actually offer one. Why did it take so long for someone to convince her that maybe a pithy jokey 'explanation' in this instance doesn't quite cut the mustard..? Yesterday I tweeted a picture which, in my ignorance, I thought was satirising US imperialism. It wasn't, it was in fact anti-Semitic and i apologise wholeheartedlyfor tweeting it. I abhor antisemitism in all forms.

Plan To Use Lawsuits To Keep It From Ever Being Built","content":"Jan 25, 2019( The American Dream: http://endoftheamericandream.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/if-president-trump-tries-to-declare-a-national-emergency-to-build-the-wall-the-democrats-plan-to-use-lawsuits-to-keep-it-from-ever-being-built/trump-wall-youtube-screenshot#mainPresident Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of declaring a national emergency in order to pave the way for the wall to be built, and it is now being reported that the White House has actually drawn up a draft proclamation to be used if Trump decides to go in that direction. But there is a very strong reason why he hasn't pulled the trigger on such a move yet. If Trump tries to make an end run around Congress in this manner, the Democrats plan to immediately take him to court. That would mean construction of the wall would be tied up in the court system for years, and if Trump lost in 2020 it would never happen at all. So if Trump is really committed to the wall, he needs to keep going with this shutdown until the Democrats finally give in. Using a national emergency to build the wall sounds like a simple solution to a lot of people, but the truth is that it would be a legal nightmare. The easy part would be actually declaring the national emergency. Presidents have made 58 national emergency declarations since 1979, and 31 of them are still in effect right now. And if a national emergency was declared, the Trump administration has identified 7 billion dollars in federal funds that could potentially be used for wall construction[1] According to options being considered, the administration could pull: $681 million from Treasury forfeiture funds, $3.6 billion in military construction, $3 billion in Pentagon civil works funds, and $200 million in Department of Homeland Security funds, the official said. But of course the Democrats are not just going to stand by and allow President Trump to do that. As Politifact[2] has noted, it is almost certain that there would be an immediate legal challenge If Trump declared a national emergency, expert said hemight rely on10 U.S. Code Section 2808[3] and 33 U.S. Code Section 2293[4]. In very broad terms, they concern the use of the armed forces to undertake military construction projects, and the termination or deferment ofArmy civil works project and using those resources to undertake other construction 'essential to the national defense.' Trump would likely face a legal challenge if he invoked either of those two provisions, experts said. Potential arguments that would riseare whether theborder wall is necessary to support the armed forces already deployed at the border, whether the construction has the appropriate approval, and whether the reallocation of funds is justified. Also a matter of debate is who would have legal standing to challenge the president's declaration. In particular, the Democrats would likely invoke the Antideficiency Act. It is unclear whether or not they would ultimately be successful, but this portion of federal law is certainly vague enough to keep the two sides tied up in the federal court system for a very long time. Ryan Alexander, the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, recently gave us some insight into what the legal strategy for the Democrats could potentially look like[5] This latest idea of actually paying for wall construction out of the DoD Appropriations bill has a major stumbling block: the Antideficiency Act[6]. Once the domain of only the most serious appropriations law nerds, the Trump era has pushed this statute out of the shadows of 'Principles of Federal Appropriations Law'[7] and made it an issue that must be discussed. Simply stated, this is the law that says money appropriated by Congress cannot be spent in advance or in excess of a congressional appropriation. Also, the act prohibits 'involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose' (emphasis added.) In effect this means funds may only be used to pay for the item or action for which the money was specifically appropriated. If President Trump does not want the construction of the wall to be tied up in court indefinitely, then he needs congressional approval, and that won't be easy. Both sides have dug their heels in, and there does not appear to be any room for a compromise. The Democrats are pledging that they will never give Trump a single penny for a border wall, and if they break that promise they will have to deal with an overwhelming political backlash. Meanwhile, the crisis on the border continues to escalate. For example, one rancher that lives on the border recently caught a smuggler in the act of trying to steal his truck[8] Grossman lives in the same area, and illegal crossers have entered his home a number of times. He recently caught a smuggler trying to steal his truck. 'I brought him back to the house,' Grossman recounted. 'And then my wife called the sheriff, and the sheriff and border patrol come up and got him and then we went back to my pickup and there was a bale of marijuana in the back of my pickup and he had stolen a lot of stuff from the house.' And the sheriff of Cochise County is desperate for the federal government to 'fix this problem'[9] that he has to deal with on a daily basis Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels oversees a border county covering more land than Connecticut. He says when the government fails to take a strong stand on immigration, it only makes things worse. 'Those that want to come into this country and harm us - terrorists - have the infrastructure to get through here in Cochise County,' he explains. 'Anytime this administration talks about amnesty or anything that has to do with the border we have an influx of people coming across. We sit back all the time and just wonder, why they won't do something to fix this problem.'' We desperately need some common sense solutions[10] in Washington, but unfortunately most members of Congress seem to be greatly lacking in common sense these days. So for now the government shutdown will continue, and it is not likely to end any time soon. http://amzn.to/1QmqcifAbout the author: Michael Snyder[11] is a nationally-syndicated writer, media personality and political activist.

Announces Review Of Brokered Deposits And Requests Comments","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  On December 18, 2018, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \"FDIC\") published an advance notice of proposed rule-making and request for comments (the \"Notice\") in connection with a comprehensive review of the regulatory approach to brokered deposits, due to the technological and market developments since the applicable rules were first adopted. The Notice also provides an overview of the current laws and regulations applicable to brokered deposits, a brief history of brokered deposits and the development of the corresponding rules and market data the FDIC has collected. The Notice describes the potential areas for attention that the FDIC has identified, including the:Definition of \"brokered deposit\" and \"deposit broker\";Exclusions from the \"deposit broker\" definition;Treatment of deposit listing services;Classification of accounting software and personal banking apps used to place deposits;Applicability of the primary purpose exception to prepaid cards; andInterest rate restrictions, including the method of calculating rates and the applicability to new products.While the Notice identifies the above areas for potential clarification or modification, the FDIC does not propose any changes at this time. Instead, the FDIC requests input from the industry on this topic, in particular with respect to the following points:The scope of the current definitions;Unaddressed developments or areas where clarity is required;Any required revisions to the current rules or FDIC materials, including Call Report instructions;Additional market data; andModifications to the interest rate restrictions, including the calculation methods, treatment of deposits with promotional or special features and treatment of internet-based or e-commerce-based institutions.The full text of the Notice is available here, and comments may be submitted here. Readers of this publication may be particularly interested in commenting on the scope of the definitions given that for various purposes retail deposits are viewed more favorably than brokered deposits and market-linked certificate of deposit programs generally are administered in a manner consistent with the taking of retail deposits.

Przypomnijmy, ze w niedziele, 13 stycznia, podczas 27. finalu WOSP prezydent Gdanska, Pawel Adamowicz, zostal kilkakrotnie ugodzony nozem. Zmarl nastepnego dnia. Doda do koncertu zaprosila wszystkich, bez wzgledu na muzyke, jaka wykonuja, a takze na to, czy sa z nia w konflikcie czy nie. Rabczewska bezposrednio w swoim apelu zwr�cila sie jednak tylko do dw�ch piosenkarek - Edyty G�rniak i Justyny Steczkowskiej . Podczas gdy G�rniak zdecydowanie odm�wila udzialu w koncercie, Steczkowska potwierdzila w nim sw�j udzial.

This is the last step in the procedure launched in September 2018, which included the opinion of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the agreement from a committee composed of representatives of the EU member states. Together with its equivalent decision adopted today by Japan, it will start applying as of today. Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality Commissioner VeraJourov said:'This adequacy decision creates the world's largest area of safe data flows.Europeans' data will benefit from high privacy standards when their data is transferred to Japan.Our companies will also benefit from a privileged access to a 127 million consumers' market.Investing in privacy pays off; this arrangement will serve as an example for future partnerships in this key area and help setting global standards.' The key elements of the adequacy decision Before the Commission adopted its adequacy decision, Japan put in place additional safeguards to guarantee that data transferred from the EU enjoy protection guarantees in line with European standards. This includes: A set of rules (Supplementary Rules) that will bridge several differencesbetween the two data protection systems.These additional safeguards will strengthen, for example, the protection of sensitive data, the exercise of individual rights and the conditions under which EU data can be further transferred from Japan to another third country. These Supplementary Rules will be binding on Japanese companies importing data from the EU and enforceable by the Japanese independent data protection authority (PPC) and courts. The Japanese government also gave assurances to the Commission regarding safeguards concerning the access of Japanese public authoritiesfor criminal law enforcement and national security purposes, ensuring that any such use of personal data would be limited to what is necessary and proportionate and subject to independent oversight and effective redress mechanisms. A complaint-handling mechanismto investigate and resolve complaints from Europeans regarding access to their data by Japanese public authorities. This new mechanism will be administered and supervised by the Japanese independent data protection authority. The adequacy decisions also complement theEU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement[1]which will enter into force in February 2019. European companies will benefit from free data flows with a key commercial partner, as well as from privileged access to the 127 million Japanese consumers. The EU and Japan affirm that, in the digital era, promoting high privacy and personal data protection standards and facilitating international trade must and can go hand in hand. Next steps The adequacy decision - as well as the equivalent decision on the Japanese side -will start applying as of today. After two years, a first joint review will be carried out to assess the functioning of the framework. This will cover all aspects of the adequacy finding, including the application of the Supplementary Rules and the assurances for government access to data. The Representatives of European Data Protection Board will participate in the review regarding access to data for law enforcement and national security purposes. Subsequently a review will take place at least every four years. Background The mutual adequacy arrangement with Japan is a part of the EU strategy in the field of international data flows and protection, as announced in January 2017 in theCommission's Communication on Exchanging and Protecting Personal Data in a Globalized World[2]. The EU and Japan successfully concluded their talks on reciprocal adequacy on 17 July 2018 (seepress release[3]). They agreed to recognize each other's data protection systems as adequate, allowing personal data to be transferred safely between the EU and Japan. In July 2017, President Juncker and Prime Minister Abe committed to adopting the adequacy decision, as part of the EU and Japan's shared commitment to promote high data protection standards on the international scene (seestatement[4]). The processing of personal data in the EU is based on theGeneral Data Protection Regulation[5](GDPR), which provides for different tools to transfer personal data to third countries, including adequacy decisions. The European Commission has the power to determine whether a country outside the EU offers an adequate level of data protection. The European Parliament and the Council can request the European Commission to maintain, amend or withdraw these decisions.

#Ukraine lawyer Andrei Domansky faces raids from security services","content":"Jan 25, 2019( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  A leading Ukraine lawyer who has tried to shine a light on abuses against journalists in his homeland has himself been targeted by the country's security services, writes Martin Banks. The home and offices of Andrei Domansky were raided by the staff of the security service of Ukraine on 17 January during which files and highly sensitive case work were seized. The raid at the two premises near Kiev came just over a month after he spoke out against attacks in Ukraine on the freedom of speech and the rights of journalists at an event at Brussels Press Club. Domansky, who also hosts a top rated TV and radio show in Ukraine,represents a number of journalists inUkrainewho have been detained or harassed for 'doing nothing more' than carrying out their professional duty. He's logged 200 such cases, 90 of them involving violence being used against journalists. In a Q...ith EUReporter, he explains why such action should be a cause for real concern, not just in Ukraine but for the EU. Q: Describe what happened at your home in connection with the investigation. A: Early one morning, knowing that I was on a business trip, the staff of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine, together with the staff of the Security Service of Ukraine, began searches at my home as well as my assistant's apartment. During the search, several documents were seized. This search in my home was a gross violation of the law. I am very grateful to my colleagues, lawyers and journalists for their support, especially the Lawyers Protection Committee of the Council of Advocates of the Kiev region. 2) What is the reason for the investigation? How do you explain what is happening? The searches that took place are instruments of pressure on me as a lawyer and human rights activist. 3) Were these events related to the fact that you are protecting the rights of journalists? Yes. As a lawyer, I have represented the interests of witnesses in criminal cases including that of Kirill Vyshinsky (who has been held in pre-trial detention since his arrest in Kiev by the Security Service ofUkraine in May).After repeated interrogations things seemed to have subsided. But after my visit to Brussels (December 10, 2018) and Washington (December 12-13), where I discussed the issues of protecting the rights of journalists and raised with our foreign colleagues the problems in Ukraine and persecution of journalists, the Ukraine Deputy Prosecutor General on 20 December filed a petition to the Pechersk District Court of Kiev to conduct searches. On January 17 these searches were carried out. The General Prosecutor's Office does not hide the fact that the matter is connected with my work to protect the rights of journalists and the politically persecuted in Ukraine. 4) Are you threatened or intimidated? Threats are constantly coming and this is one of the risks of my work. But if you are afraid, then you need to stop such activities. Ukraine is a legal state and I exercise my protection within the framework of the law and my oath as a lawyer. 5) What is your opinion on the protection of the rights of journalists and their lawyers?Ukraine has one of the best constitutions and good laws have been adopted. Guarantees against violations of the rights of journalists and lawyers are fixed. But what's at issue is their implementation and the authorities' desire to fulfil their duties to protect the rights of journalists and lawyers. This is the problem. Little wonder that the number of 'prisoners of conscience' and lawsuits to the European Court of Human Rights are growing. 6) How can the international community help improve the situation? First, don't be indifferent to the violations of the professional rights of journalists and lawyers but react to them. Without public interest and attention from the international community, we cannot eliminate these violations and there's a strong possibility they will be repeated in the future. Clearly, we still need to learn a lot to improve democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine, in particular, learn respect for a different opinion and the right to freedom of speech. This applies not only to journalists and lawyers but also LGBT people. 7) Has the situation with the protection of the rights of journalists improved or worsened over the past three years? There are guarantees in law to protect the rights of journalists but, unfortunately, there's unwillingness to respect these. Unfortunately, reporters do not have the unity in their profession to stop such pressures. The most vulnerable are journalists who carry out investigative work, especially to root out corruption. They are persecuted by the authorities and receive threats to their health and lives. Unfortunately, we forget that the right to information is guaranteed both by the Ukraine constitution and international treaties which Ukraine is party to. Pursuing journalists and harassing them is a violation of their rights. 8) Is there any hope for improvement after the elections of this year? I hope that the issues of freedom of speech and protection of journalists and lawyers - indeed, anyone - does not depend just on the elections. I stress that Ukraine is a legal, democratic, European state. The people of Ukraine are freedom loving and have always been famous for their desire for freedom.Our ancestors fought for freedom' and freedom features in our national anthem. Therefore, I do not just have hope but confidence that there will be improvements. The main thing is that such rights should not be violated and, if there are such violations, they must be stopped and punished with the utmost severity. 9) Are there any other observations or comments you would like to add? The unwillingness of the authorities to exercise Kirill Vyshinsky's rights and his access to justice is one other violation. But Ukraine citizens have the right to exercise their rights by applying to the European Court of Human Rights and ECHR rulings are binding.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:46Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721612&p=4s5&v=1&x=vutpany0d-UX6wwkBK56yg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"1006","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

Asia, New Frontiers In Dispute Resolution: CIArb (Malaysia Branch) International Arbitration Conference 2018 Keynote Address","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  At the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (Malaysia Branch) International Arbitration Conference 2018, Peter Godwin, the Managing Partner of Herbert Smith Freehills' Kuala Lumpur office gave a keynote address. The topic of the address was ldquo;Evolving Asia, New Frontiers in Dispute Resolutionrdquo;.The text of Peter's keynote is set out below.Keynote Address - Evolving Asia, New Frontiers in Dispute ResolutionGood afternoon,When asked to speak, I thought I ought to ask what the organisers would like me to speak about. The answer was that so long as I fitted broadly within the conference theme, anything goes. Perhaps, a slightly dangerous approach to give a lawyer a blank canvas and a microphone.I got thinking about what the Asian arbitration scene had looked like when I first arrived in Asia. Initially I arrived in Hong Kong in January 1998 and then I moved to Tokyo in August 2000 which was when I really turned my attention to the world of arbitration, having previously focussed primarily on litigation.Without doubt, the Asia arbitration scene looked very different. Perhaps the only things that have not changed are thatHong Kong International Arbitration Centre (ldquo;HKIACrdquo;), Singapore International Arbitration Centre (ldquo;SIACrdquo;) and China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (ldquo;CIETACrdquo;) were the three most well-known institutions whilst the institutions such as the likes of Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration (ldquo;KLRCArdquo;) in Malaysia and Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (ldquo;JCAArdquo;) in Japan were vocal in their keenness to win a greater market share. They still are as are the respective Governments.Badan Arbitrase Nasional Indonesia (ldquo;BANIrdquo;) and Indonesia generally were perceived to be best avoided. Now BANI is battling with a new arbitral institution also called BANI for supremacy in Indonesia, it is still best avoided for now. In the Indonesian courts there have been three separate actions between BANI and BANI and its currently two to one to BANI.To put things in context when I moved to Japan, a number of my colleagues were convinced I had committed career suicide. Across the whole of Asia, Herbert Smith Freehills had just two arbitration partners.It is fair to say that, in those days, the Japanese were not known for conflict and certainly not for airing that conflict in front of a third-party foreigner like myself.When I relocated to Malaysia nearly 17 years on, I was leading a team of 14 partners across Asia of whom 5 were based in Tokyo and we were the busiest part of our global practice. So our growth closely mirrors the growth of the Asian arbitration market.This success is due to a number of things that have changed over that period of time, including but not limited to;Intra-Asia investment flows increasing significantly.The number of disputes inevitably grew; many to be determined by arbitration.SIAC in particular grew in prominence, this was not by accident. It was an intense marketing campaign and stole a march on likes of HKIAC and ICC International Court of Arbitration (ldquo;ICCrdquo;).SIAC's growth and enhanced reputation attracted companies to keep their Asian disputes in Asia rather than sending them to ICC which had often been the practice in Europe.We lived through a few financial crises. Tough economic times meant companies, even historically cash rich Japanese ones, were unable to buy their way out of disputes and so learned to use processes (including arbitration) to delay payments, etc. Once these lessons have been learned, they tend to stay learned even when economic times improve.In Japan at least, the first generation of GCs who had spent time in the US appeared, bringing with them just a touch of that US litigation culture. The subtle but very definite change in attitude is perhaps most obviously illustrated by my own practice when I was in Japan. For a number of years on arrival, I would act for Japanese Companies as Defendants. By the time I left the majority of my work was for Japanese Companies as Claimant.Elsewhere, China grew in prominence as an economic powerhouse; ASEAN started to see enormous growth with much more to come, etc.Whilst the economic power of Asian countries grew, the reliability and sophistication of the local courts did not always keep pace so encouraging parties to seek alternatives. The obvious alternative was arbitration.Unsurprisingly, all of the above has proved good news for lawyers, especially arbitration lawyers.STATISTIC OF INSTITUTIONS*Stats are sourced from various third-party sources online and the official statistic of the respective institutions.As the number of Asia based cases increased, what else have we seen change?The European mafia no longer rule the roost in terms of arbitrator appointments for Asian cases.International law firms remain prominent but generally through having arbitration lawyers resident in the region. The FIFO model of old is not extinct but it is on the decline.Even the London bar, which dare I say is not renowned for its speed of response to the modern world, has recognised this trend with barristers chambers opening offices in Asia, including in KL to try to recapture ground being taken away by other parts of the legal profession.A new cadre of Asian arbitration lawyers is growing. This will continue and we will see more and more Asian arbitrators appointed as we should. However, this also gives rise to some short-term challenges about which I will say more later.New arbitration centres are sprouting up all over the place (eg. Brunei, Pakistan and Cambodia even the Maldives, Mauritius and Sydney) and others are reinventing themselves to try to compete more effectively (eg. Japan, Korea, AIAC itself).So you could be forgiven for thinking all is rosy in the world of arbitration, right? Wrong: in recent years arbitration has come in for a good deal of criticism. Much of this has been in the investment arbitration arena but some has spilled over into the world of commercial arbitration.Indeed, such criticism has reached levels that in a lecture he delivered in London recently Gary Born, who will be known to many of you in the room, and is unarguably one of the most prominent of all international arbitration practitioners, was moved to say that people should stop criticising arbitration arguing that those who attack international arbitration attack cross-border trade and commerce and the rule of law in international life. Instead he urged people to espouse the benefits of arbitration which he described as the 5E's - efficiency, expedition, expertise, even-handedness and enforceability.I agree but that is not to say we can afford to ignore the criticism and nor did Gary suggest we should.For my part, I consider it important that as a community we are not complacent about the problems we face but we must see the criticisms as opportunities for improvement; we must each seek to address these challenges whether acting as counsel or arbitrator as, by working together, much can be achieved to ensure that parties and counsel conduct proceedings in an efficient manner.So to be clear, what are the challenges we face? According to one of the Queen Mary surveys on international arbitration, the worst characteristics of international arbitration (in descending order) are:costs;lack of effective sanctions during the arbitral process; in this regard, whilst costs sanctioning is a well established and widely used method of policing the behaviour of parties and counsel, arbitrators have traditionally been reluctant to use the full range of their powers for fear of rendering their awards open to challenge;lack of insight into arbitrators' efficiency: it is surely incumbent on any of us sitting as arbitrators not to be the cause of any inefficiency in the process;lack of speed;national court intervention;lack of third-party mechanism: ICC and others have sought to address this in recent years;lack of appeal mechanism on the merits;lack of insight into institutions efficiency; andlack of flexibility.Much of this has been written and spoken about in recent years. Some have predicted the demise of arbitration as a consequence yet the number of cases continues to increase. Others, like Gary Born, have told the arbitration community to stop complaining about the imperfections in the system possibly for fear of this becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our collective challenge is how do we make a real difference? We cannot be complacent and expect all to be well if we do nothing; equally we cannot wait for the institutions to introduce new rules which will miraculously resolve the issues: if only it was so simple.We all need to understand the issues and in every case we handle whether as counsel or as arbitrator, we need to be proactively looking for solutions in the context of those specific cases. Every little helps!So my challenge to each of you here today is to ask yourself what you, individually, can do on the cases you are involved in? And collectively, do we have the ambition, or bravery, to try to lead from the front and show the rest of the region or the world a path to a more efficient, cost effective and flexible arbitration process fit the 21st Century?Let us not forget that when the CIArb was founded in the UK in 1915, it was at a time when arbitration was seen as a quick, efficient alternative to litigation. Whilst many clients still believe this true, we know better!So having set you that challenge, is it within our control to achieve?There is no doubt in my mind that lawyers are a part of the problem. One of the consequences of our involvement is that arbitral procedure has come to mirror court procedure and consequently, even for smaller claims, some of the flexibility that should be an advantage for arbitration has been eroded. This is the case in Europe as well as in Asia but I would suggest Asia is perhaps a little behind due to the relative inexperience of the arbitration bar and the fact that many Asian jurisdictions are still developing as arbitral centres.Of course, I generalise but the trend one sees across the region is that as arbitration grows in popularity more lawyers are becoming involved either because they have existing clients who find themselves engaged in an arbitration and they want their trusted adviser to act for them or because the lawyers themselves have seen the opportunity to build a career as an arbitration practitioner. This is a good thing of course.The vast majority of this new generation have started out as litigators. It is therefore no surprise that as they learn the arbitration ropes, when in doubt, they default to adopting practices and procedures familiar to them from the court systems in which they grew up. I can recall doing exactly the same thing when I started out.By way of example of this, when I arrived in Japan in 2000, one of the most oft-heard complaints about the JCAA was that their proceedings looked like those of the Tokyo District Court. Japan is of course a civil law jurisdiction.As a quick aside, for any young arbitration practitioners out there, my one tip: the best arbitrators and counsel have a strong grasp of both comparative law and comparative procedure. So as a common lawyer, if you can find a way to be exposed to civil law, and vice versa, grasp that opportunity.As is not uncommon in the courts in civil law jurisdictions, this included hearings being conducted a day or two at a time, and often with months between hearings. That is manageable when the lawyers, witnesses, etc. are all residents in Tokyo but as soon as one is flying lawyers, witnesses, experts etc. from overseas, the impracticality, not to mention cost, of such a system is a positive deterrent to efficient dispute resolution.In 1991, having just completed a JCAA case, Charles Ragan, a US attorney, wrote an article complaining about this practice, and many other elements of JCAA arbitration as it was. Happily the JCAA recognised that and practices have now changed to be far more akin to the usual international practice. Indeed I wrote an article called 'Bursting the Ragan myth' back in 2008 updating the arbitration community of what arbitration in Japan is actually like.Turning to Malaysia, what have I observed thus far? Generally the adoption of a lot of the best international practice which is great but where I have cause for concern is the length of hearings. Both anecdotally, and from my own admittedly quite limited experience, I would suggest that hearings in Malaysian arbitrations are materially longer than elsewhere in Asia. It is not yet clear to me why that is, save that a number of local lawyers have suggested to me that the style of cross examination in the Malaysian courts is relatively long-winded and that is reflected in arbitration too. Many of you will know better than I if this is fair comment.It is well-known how expensive hearing days are so, if this is correct, this is something I would urge us all to reflect upon and potentially seek to change. This is very much within our control as lawyers (whether counsel or arbitrators).Unfortunately, not everything is within our control as we have to answer to our clients. But clients will welcome anything that makes arbitration quicker and cheaper I hear you say. In theory, of course that is right but, in practice, things get a tad more challenging. Let me try to illustrate what I mean.Pleadings in arbitration (whether common law style or memorial style) are intended to narrow the issues in dispute. Unfortunately it has almost become the norm that if a 'claim' is 20 pages long, the 'defence' will be 40 pages, the 'reply' 80 pages and the 'rejoinder' 100 pages. You get the idea. Every document seems to broaden the issues in dispute not narrow them.We all know that we will win a case based on one or two of our strongest arguments. If they fail, the chances of winning based on our tenth argument are slim indeed. Nevertheless, as lawyers, we seem to be largely incapable of not dealing with every argument raised against us in the same level of detail. Should we not have the courage of our convictions and focus on our, say, three best arguments, and be prepared to deal with the remainder in cursory fashion?It sounds obvious and straightforward but even if you as the lawyer favour that approach, (let's be clear it's quite a brave call), how do you persuade your client to adopt that approach? In my experience, clients not only want you to deal with all ten arguments made against them but also like to throw in a couple of case theories of their own which they naturally believe are winners.So I would suggest to you the required change is not entirely within our control but we must try to we must enlist the help of our clients in trying.If we choose to ignore the challenge, there are a number of wannabe processes, institutions and conventions lining up to steal away our business. These include:Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI) launched in 2014;soon to be enhanced by the Singapore Convention on Enforcement of Mediated Settlement Agreements. The Singapore Convention will be signed in Singapore on 1 August 2019 and will come into effect six months after at least three states have ratified it;Japan International Mediation Center (JIMC-Kyoto) announced but not yet open;international commercial courts;SingaporeLondonAbu DhabiQatarDubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)Two in China for the anticipated Belt ...ad disputesstatutory adjudication regimes for construction payment disputes;Kuala LumpurSingaporeand then there is technology: a huge subject for another day but one that is bound to give rise to both opportunities and threatsThe good news is that there is still time to stop whinging, to promote the benefits of arbitration and to potentially make a few changes for the better.Last year, some of you may have participated in the Global Pound Conference. This was an ambitious initiative in which my firm was heavily involved to inform how civil and commercial disputes are resolved in the 21st century.The series brought together over 4,000 people from across the spectrum of dispute resolution stakeholders, at 28 conferences spanning 24 countries worldwide and was used to identify key insights that emerged from extensive voting data collected during the series, with a focus on the needs of corporate users of dispute resolution.Six Asia-Pacific cities hosted conferences to assess how dispute resolution can be improved: (Singapore, Hong Kong, Chandigarh, Bangkok, Sydney and Auckland). Region-wide, the data highlights that commercial parties want to use mediation and other ADR processes more, either alone or as an adjunct to adversarial proceedings.However, the data shows that the market is not responding adequately. As a result, mediation remains under-utilised and actual use lag behind positive attitudes to it. Unless parties and their advisors actively take a different course (for example through inserting escalation clauses in contracts, actively proposing mediation at the point of dispute or by following mandatory mediation protocols), there is likely to remain a perpetuation of the 'same old processes': litigation and arbitration.So as I said, we still have time to improve the somewhat tarnished image of international arbitration.Ladies and gentlemen, join me in being bold, being ambitious and being efficient. Let us write 6 December 2018 in the history of Malaysia as the day the local arbitration community decided to lead the world.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Industry Group Preparing to Call for Backstop to be Time Limited or Scrapped","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Guido Fawkes' Blog: http://www.order-order.com Delivered by Newstex)  Guido can reveal that at least one major industry group is planning to come out early next week and call for the backstop to be scrapped or substantially amended to include a short time limit. The industry is closely linked to Brexit issues and the business group which represents it is intending to call for negotiations on the backstop to be reopened in order to get a 'sensible resolution' to the Brexit process. An industry insider told Guido: 'The withdrawal agreement without the backstop would be a good negotiating result for the U.K. It delivers the Brexit that many Leavers want, and is the only way to guarantee No Deal is taken off the table. So the removal of the backstop could be the cause that finally unites Parliament. Barnier and the Commission have accidentally shown they agreed with David Davis all along. There does not have to be a hard physical border with Ireland, and Max Fac is not 'wishful thinking' but a common sense approach. This is the best chance all sides have to a sensible resolution.' After the EU's torrid week where they fatally undermined[1] their own rationale for needing the backstop at all, this is looking like an increasingly viable path to a workable deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris have hinted that they might be prepared[2] to come round to the deal if the backstop was substantially altered or removed, and it has been the DUP's main demand for months. Significantly, Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady tabled a new amendment last night with the backing of Remainer May ally Damian Green, Andrew Murrison[3] and all the officers of the 1922 Committee, which: 'requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border; supports leaving the European Union with a deal and would therefore support the Withdrawal Agreement subject to this change.' There will no doubt be plenty of huffing and puffing from the EU side about how changes aren't possible, but if this amended deal is approved by the House of Commons, the EU will inevitably come under serious pressure to modify its own position. This could finally be the route that gets the UK out of the exit door on time The post Major Industry Group Preparing to Call for Backstop to be Time Limited or Scrapped[4] appeared first on Guido Fawkes[5].

EU invests further �800 million in priority energy infrastructure","content":"Jan 25, 2019( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  Member states have voted on a Commission proposal to invest almost �800 million in keyEuropean energy infrastructure projects[1]with major cross-border benefits. The EU funding comes from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the European support programme for trans-European infrastructure. Priority is given to projects that increase competitiveness, enhance the EU's security of energy supply through the promotion of safe, secure and efficient network operation, and contribute to sustainable development and environmental protection. Creating a connected, modern energy grid represents a crucial element of the Energy Union, one of the political priorities of the Juncker Commission. Energy Union Commission Vice President Maro��efcovicaffirmed:'CEF is one of those instruments that prove the EU's added value. Today's approved list showcases that Energy Union is an efficient tool to modernize and green our economies, to make them future proof in line with climate and environmental goals.' Climate Action and Energy Commissioner MiguelArias Ca�etesaid:'As a crucial element of our overall energy and climate strategy, we need to ensure that our energy infrastructure is sustainable, goal-oriented, and operational. With almost two thirds of today's investment decision devoted to electricity, we are delivering on our promise to align EU funding with our political ambition to deliver the clean energy transition. We continue to invest in the right energy infrastructure projects which are essential to the EU's clean energy transition and security of supply. I am particularly pleased by the support given to the Baltic electricity synchronization project, which will help materialize the Baltic States' ambition to integrate their electricity system with continental Europe and improve security of supply in the Baltic region.' Thevote concerns CEF financial aid for studies and works for a total of 14 projects: 7 for electricity, 2 for smart grids, 2 for CO2 cross-border transportation and 3 for gas. The proposed CEF-Energy funding amounts to almost �800 million, with electricity and smart grids accounting for �504m, �9.3m to support studies on the development of a CO2 transport infrastructure; and �286m allocated to the gas sector.This current call for proposals (2018-2) was launched in June and closed on October 11th 2018. In the electricity sector, a �323m grant is awarded to theBaltic electricity synchronisation project.The Baltic States remain synchronously connected to the central dispatch facility of Russia, hindering their full integration into EU electricity markets. The project aims to increase the security of supply and reliability of the power systems in the region through their synchronous connection to the Continental European Network (CEN). In June of 2018, EU leaders agreed thepolitical road map[2]for completing the synchronization. On smart grids, support has been approved for the ACON SG project to modernize and improve the power grid between Czechia and the Slovak Republic. The �91 million grant will now contribute to the setting up of smart grids in the border region. Moreover, �6.5m in funding will be allocated to a study on the development of aCO2 infrastructure in the Port of Rotterdam. The objective is to establish an open access, cross-border, carbon dioxide network in North-West Europe, with its core located in the Port of Rotterdam. Finally, in the gas sector, the CEF will support, with nearly �215m, theBaltic Pipe project, a new, bi-directionaloffshore gas interconnection between Poland and Denmark. This pipeline will be crucial for security of supply and market integration of the region. Background The CEF envisages a total budget of �5.35 billion for trans-European energy infrastructure for the period 2014-2020. In order to be eligible for a grant, a proposal has to be'a project of common interest'[3](PCI). When completed, the projects will each result in significant benefits for at least two member states, enhance security of supply, contribute to market integration, and enhance competition, as well as reduce CO2 emissions. The Union-wide list of Projects of Common Interest is updated every two years. Thelatest PCI list[4]was published by the Commission in November 2017. The CEF-Energy already granted �647m to 34 projects in 2014, �366m to 35 projects in 2015, �707m to 27 projects in 2016, and �873m to 17 projects in 2017. In thenext long-term EU budget 2021-2027[5], the European Commission has proposed to renew the Connecting Europe Facility, allocating �42.3bn to support investments in European infrastructure networks, including �8.7bn for energy.

Africa has won the prestigious Dakar Rally 2019, having had their cars and spare parts transported by South African Airways Cargo. \n \nThe two cars, weighing about two tonnes, were seamlessly transported along with spare parts to Sao Paulo, Brazil en route to Lima, Peru by SAA Cargo. \n \nEach car takes about three hours to disassemble and about six hours to reassemble, and were designed in line with size restrictions for commercial cargo holds. \n \nThey were built in such a way that they could be disassembled to the size of a cargo pallet and container to be used. \n \nThe race took place from 6 to 17 January across 10 long and gruelling stages in southern Peru, and tests vehicle durability, driver endurance and technical ability to the limit. \n \nThe car driven by Nasser Al Attiyah and navigator Mathieu Baumel won the event, with Giniel de Villiers and Dirk von Zitzewitz coming ninth. \n \nGlyn Hall, team principal of Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa says: �Winning the Dakar Rally has been our goal from the start. Now that we�ve achieved that goal, it is clear that South African technology and design is not only good enough to compete at the highest levels, but also to win.� \n \nJustice Luthuli, acting general manager of SAA Cargo says: �We are elated that Toyota have continued to entrust us with the responsibility to transport their vehicles.  We are also very proud of the association with the winning team. \n \n�We congratulate Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa for their outstanding finish at the world�s most gruelling off-road race.

court orders release of hunger striking Kurdish MP","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Turkish court on Friday ordered the supervised release of a detained lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) who is seriously ill as a result of her 11-week hunger strike.Leyla Guven, 55, launched a hunger strike on November 8 in protest at the prison conditions for Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan and her deteriorating health has sparked concerns and rallies to support her cause.The MP will be monitored after she is freed, the court in Diyarbakir in the Kurdish majority southeast said, although few further details of the terms of her release are yet available. Guven, whose party has said is suffering a \"life-threatening\" medical condition, did not attend the hearing, according to an AFP journalist in the court.She was arrested in January 2018 for her criticism of Turkey's military operation against a Syrian Kurdish militia that Ankara considers an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The MP started the hunger strike in prison and her action was supported by more than 150 prisoners across Turkey in a show of solidarity. Guven's hunger strike was aimed at pressuring the government into allowing lawyers and family members to visit PKK leader Ocalan, who has been serving a life sentence on an island prison near Istanbul since his capture in 1999.Ocalan met his brother Mehmet for the first time in more than two years on January 12. The details of that meeting were not yet made public.In 2012, hundreds of Kurdish prisoners ended a 68-day hunger strike after Ocalan urged them to do so.Guven's HDP party remains under the scrutiny of Turkish authorities, which accuse it of links to the PKK. Several of its MPs are behind bars, including former party leader Selahattin Demirtas.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:42Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721127&p=4s5&v=1&x=_mBea0HMXP3nHGY7tb1Ymw","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"303","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

However, other hotels really go above and beyond when it comes to welcoming their pet guests.  In North Carolina, a few top hotels do a great job at this, and they truly put the �friendly� in pet friendly.  We�ve come up with the best NC hotels for pets, based on pet fees, how many and what types of pets are allowed, awesome pet amenities, and their overall pet friendly atmosphere. \nAtlantis Lodge at Atlantic Beach \nAtlantis Lodge in Atlantic Beach is a pet�s paradise!  They welcome their dog and cat visitors by keeping their pet fees low and their pet amenity offerings high!  Their pet fees are only $15/night, and their pet amenities include pet sheets, cookies, poop scoops and bags, as well as a dedicated dog park.  Plus, Atlantis Lodge is located right on a breathtaking dog friendly beach! And, their on-site pet washing stations help furry guests get clean after playing in the nearby sand and sea.  Atlantis Lodge welcomes up to 2 pets per suite, and there are no weight limits or breed restrictions for furry visitors! \n Kimpton Tryon Park Hotel - Charlotte \nThis pet-centric, urban retreat welcomes pets, and its great location is close to pet friendly shops, breweries, and restaurants in the heart of downtown Charlotte.  This boutique hotel is known for its exceptional pet program, where pets always stay free, there is no pet deposit, and any number of pets are welcome regardless of how many, how large, what kind, and what type.  When it comes to pet amenities, they aim to please! Extra perks for pets include soft pet beds; food, water bowls, and mats; as well as a concierge list of nearby pet friendly restaurants, parks, groomers, and pet boutiques.  Human guests have access to courtesy bags, making for easy clean-up when walking pooches on the property. There are also evening wine receptions, where people and their pets are welcome to mix and mingle with other hotel guests. \nKimpton Cardinal Hotel - Winston-Salem \nThis hotel can be described as a combination of classic elegance with a modern flair!  It is conveniently located near the thriving arts scene, shops, and outdoor restaurants in downtown Winston-Salem that welcome furry family members.  Along with all other pet-centric Kimpton Hotels, the Cardinal rolls out the red carpet for pets who visit! There are no pet fees, weight or breed restrictions, and pets of any type and amount are invited to stay.  Pet amenities are abundant, with pet beds, pet bowls and mats, dog waste bags, and �pet in room� door hangers provided for pet guests. When checking-in, guests receive a concierge list of pet friendly places to visit in the area, as well as a list of local services that cater to pets.  Additionally, mid-afternoon snacks and beverages are featured in the luxurious lobby, along with a wine hour in the evenings (where pets are also welcome) to bring the days to a close in style. \n DoubleTree by Hilton Asheville-Biltmore in Asheville  \nThis property�s location is a huge draw for people and their pets, as it sits right across the street from the Biltmore Village with its multiple pet friendly shops and restaurants.  In addition, hiking trails along the nearby Blue Ridge Parkway provide a wonderful reprieve from city life! At the hotel, large pets up to 75 lbs. are welcome, and they get a special treat upon checking-in.  The accommodations include suites with separate bedrooms, which many guests find to be a necessity when staying for an extended time with their pets. The property also provides special outdoor dog walking areas for stretching and getting some exercise.   \nAloft Hotel in Raleigh \nAloft Hotels are known for their modern-day vibes, and they cater to pet guests in a hip way, too!  The Raleigh location is within walking distance of the downtown area, with its many pet friendly outdoor shops, restaurants, and sightseeing tours.  When it comes to pet guests, Aloft is most known for the Animals R Fun (ARF) program, which allows dogs to stay free!  Pooches can accompany their pet parents to the stylish hotel lobby, where they are greeted with a special bed, bowl, a bag of treats, and toys to use during their stay.  Guests also receive a concierge list of the dog friendly things to do in the area, such as walking around the heart of North Carolina State University�s campus, which is right across the street! \n\nAbout TripsWithPets: \n\nTripsWithPets is the premier online pet friendly travel guide -- featuring online reservations at over 30,000 pet friendly hotels & accommodations across the U.S. and Canada.

launches sports sex assaults investigation","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  South Korea will launch an inquiry into sexual and other abuses in the nation's scandal-ridden sports community, the government said Friday, as the sports minister called for an end to its \"win-at-all-costs\" mentality.Double Olympic short track gold medallist Shim Suk-hee earlier this month went public with accusations her former coach molested her multiple times, prompting several other victims to come forward. South Korea is a regional sporting power and regularly in the top 10 medal table places at the summer and winter Olympics.But in an already intensely competitive society, winning is virtually everything in its sports community and coaches hold immense power over athletes' careers -- intimidating victims from coming forward.\"I want to apologise to athletes, their families and citizens in South Korea for not preventing such incidents of abuse,\" said sports minister Do Jong-hwan.\"With this probe, we need to walk away from the winning-at-all-costs philosophy,\" he told reporters. \"We can no longer push athletes into a fierce competition system under the name of national pride.\" The sports, education and gender equality ministries will draw up a plan to revise relevant laws to jail sports officials who do not report sex crimes in their organisations, Do added. A separate probe will be launched into the Korea National Sport University, he said, where a staff member has been accused of sexually molesting a student athlete.Not all the cases involve sexual assaults, and not all the victims are women.in November, South Korea's \"Garlic Girls\" curling team, who shot to fame by winning Olympic silver at last year's Pyeongchang Games, accused their coaches of verbal abuse and being excessively controlling. Another speed skater, Noh Seon-yeong, last year accused the Korea Skating Union (KSU) of forcing her brother Jin-kyu -- a top medal contender for Sochi 2014 -- to stay in training rather than seek medical attention despite chronic pain.He was later diagnosed with bone cancer following a training injury, never went to Sochi and died in 2016.\"My brother was just used by the KSU, whose members were only interested in collecting Olympic gold medals,\" Noh said.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:42Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721132&p=4s5&v=1&x=FANxUTm7lqHpUZpyqLWDBA","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"379","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

teaser: Salman Khan's narration will invoke a sense of pride for the nationRead More","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Bollywood Life: https://www.bollywoodlife.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  So Salman Khan[1] decided to throw a surprise for his legion of fans this morning and dropped the teaser of his much-awaited Eid release Bharat[2]. Surprise, because so far everyone expected the teaser to release on Republic Day tomorrow. But we're not complaining as we see Salman's five different looks from the film. In case you missed it, there are glimpses of Katrina Kaif[3] and Sunil Grover[4] too. But that's that. What stood out for us was the narration in the voice of Salman Khan himself. \"Aksar log mujhse poochte hain, ke mera surname kya hai, dharam kya hai, jaati kya hai... Aur main unse muskura ke kehta hun ke is desh ke naame pe mere bauji ne mera naam Bharat rakha. Ab itne bade naam ke aage jaati, dharam, surname lagake na to apna aur na is desh ka maan kam kar sakta hun.\" *Instant feeling of pride* These lines remind us of how we live in unity despite the diversity in India. We are a secular state and all that matters is that despite our differences we all belong to one soil, our country. The teaser sends out a very important message and it only goes on to raise the bar of expectations from the film. In case you haven't watched the trailer yet, check it out right here...[embedded content] Just yesterday, producer Atul Agnihotri shared some BTS videos from the shoot locations that only raised our excitement for the teaser, especially after the countdown that he had initiated. The film has been shot at various locations including UAE and Punjab. Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, the film also stars Disha Patani and Tabu in prominent roles. The film has a cameo appearance by Varun Dhawan. It is an official remake of a Korean film Ode to my Father and is spread across 60 years.

School Reunion Themed Valentine�s Day Party","content":"A Valentine�s Day Party where everyone comes dressed in clothes from High School just might be our very favorite couple�s party to date! We love a fun night spent with good friends! A casual Adult Game Night, a fun White Elephant Gift Exchange, or a Couples Dinner Party are a few favorite options, but this High School Reunion party just takes the cake! Couple�s Valentine�s Day Party Years ago my husband decided to do away with planning our annual Christmas party and instead do a couple�s Valentine�s Day Party instead. One of our favorite parties that we planned was a High School Reunion theme where all our friends dressed in the era of the year they graduated -OR- they wore something they still had hanging in their closets that they owned in high school. The night was super fun, here is how it all went down �\n*All Printables mentioned are available for you to download at the end of this post!   Valentine�s Day Party Invitations We kept it super simple with the date and location + what the expectations were as far as attire and the white elephant gift exchange were concerned. Valentine�s Day Party Set Up We kept the decor very simple � yearbooks, popular school novels and school supplies served as centerpieces. We also had a vase of markers for the game we were playing in the center of each table. Valentine�s Day Party Dinner Guests were treated to a casual dinner- cafeteria style! It was a buffet line with rectangular Styrofoam plates* and everyone�s favorite school lunch- Pizza! We asked our guests to bring a side to share, so we had a variety of options. Drinks were cartons of milk and juice (we did have some soda too) and for dessert, ice cream cups with wooden spoons! * Check the dollar store for the styrofoam plates � I�ve purchased packs of 10 or 20 for $1 several times! Valentine�s Day Party Ideas The entertainment for the night was our White Elephant Gift Exchange. We did this 2 years ago and people have been asking us to do another one since that crazy night! Here is how we did it: Everyone wrote down their spouses �little known secret� and all papers went into the bowl. (Remember, since these are secrets coming from their spouses mouths, people got really creative and dug deep since it wasn�t revealing anything about themselves!) One at a time, I pulled out a secret from the bowl and gave everyone a chance to laugh at guess who�s secret it was. Whoever�s secret it was got to pick a gift from the white elephant pile. Each gift could be stolen 2x�s before it became �frozen�. We literally laughed all night long- first at the secrets, then at the funny gifts people brought for the exchange! High School Reunion � Class Favorites The last thing we did for the night was chose our �class favorites.� I had ballots on the table for all guests to write down who at the party should get the titles for �Best Smile, Best Dressed, Most Athletic� etc. We tallied up the votes and gave some awards to the winners. Here are the prizes we gave, all purchased at the dollar store. Best Smile- Toothpaste Best Eyes- Giant Sunglasses Class Clowns- Laffy Taffy Cutest Couple- Sweethearts Most Athletic- Foam Baseball Most Likely to Succeed- Calculator Best Hair- Comb Best Dressed- Plastic Hangers The cutest couple winners weren�t even a couple, they just both happened to wear their prom clothes so it fit! They were shocked when their names were read! �and that is it! Pizza, ice cream and a white elephant party- this really can�t get any easier to plan!

Altantuya Shaariibuu was shot dead and her body blown up with military-grade plastic explosives near Kuala Lumpur in 2006. Her death is said to be part of a scandal involving claims an associate of ousted prime minister Najib Razak arranged huge kickbacks for the purchase of French submarines in 2002. Allegations have long circulated that Najib -- then deputy premier -- and his wife Rosmah Mansor were involved in the killing. Both have denied the claims.Two government bodyguards were convicted of the murder and sentenced to death, with one subsequently fleeing to Australia. Altantuya's lover Abdul Razak Baginda, a close aide to Najib, was also tried but acquitted of abetting the crime.In 2007, Altantuya's family, led by her father Shaariibuu Setev, filed a 100 million ringgit ($24 million) lawsuit against the government, the bodyguards and Abdul Razak.The case was delayed until the criminal trial wrapped up, but finally got underway this week.\"(We) will do everything that we can to uncover the mystery as to who ordered her murder,\" Ramkarpal Singh, a lawyer for the family, told AFP.\"Mr Shaariibuu and his team are confident that justice will prevail.\"Beginning his testimony in the case Friday, Altantuya's father said: \"She told me she was in a relationship with a big man in Malaysia and his name was Baginda.\" He will continue testifying at the High Court in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur, on Monday.Malaysian authorities reopened the investigation into Altantuya's murder last year, months after Najib was ousted in a shock election that saw his former boss Mahathir Mohamad return to power. In a potentially major breakthrough, the bodyguard who fled to Australia, Sirul Azhar Umar, has said he is willing to assist any new government investigation into the case.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:42Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721179&p=4s5&v=1&x=ZEZkuwZccMuyyOqX_MONEQ","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"343","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

A couple has been together for years. They have been living together for more than a year. The female member expects to hear a marriage proposal� perhaps for Christmas. The male member offers her a ring for Christmas� only it�s not an engagement ring. He emphasizes the point. She feels insulted. Or some such. She is profoundly disappointed and keeps the friendship ring as a sign of rejection. Or some such. The couple has had the marriage conversation before. Boyfriend has said that the couple still has some work to do before that momentous event. Meaning what exactly? We do not know. She feels that something is wrong, so she writes to therapist Lori Gottlieb. Naturally, we know nothing beyond her feelings. We do not know about friends and family. We do not know who pursues which career. We do not know who supports the family. We do not know how they divide their chores and define their roles. We do not even know how old they are. We do know that her biological clock is running out, fact that does not seem to register on the boyfriend�s radar. In short, we know nothing about this couple, beyond the fact that she wants to be engaged and that the ring she received for Christmas tells her that she is not yet marriageable. Here is the letter, from Anna in Seattle: For Christmas this year, my boyfriend surprised me with a ring. It�s sapphire and silver�beautiful. But it�s not an engagement ring. Without saying so outright, he made clear that it was just a ring. After dating for a few years, and living together for the past year and a half, I can�t help but be disappointed. To make matters worse, when I went to the store to get the ring resized, the clerk kept congratulating me and asking me all about my fianc�. I wasn�t expecting to get engaged over the holidays�my boyfriend has also said he doesn�t want to propose on a holiday, or my birthday, or some other occasion so that he won�t �ruin it� if the marriage goes badly. We�ve talked about marriage and getting engaged, but he also says he thinks we still have some things to work on in our relationship. I�ve tried to advocate for myself and tell him that I have my own timeline and expectations, but that I�m willing to give him the time he needs. But now, with this ring, I wonder whether that�s still in the cards. I can�t imagine him getting me two rings in the same year, given that this is the first piece of jewelry he�s ever bought me. I�m worried he�s finding new ways of putting off our engagement without having to talk to me about it. So this is my question: Is my disappointment unreasonable? I definitely feel the pull of marriage while I am still young enough to have children. I also know that I love my boyfriend and am dedicated to making our relationship work long-term. Am I disappointed because he hasn�t picked me yet, or because I have real fears about the longevity of our relationship? She is asking the right questions. She does not ask how best to let him know that she is disappointed, and Gottlieb will address that issue. For now, I agree with Gottlieb on a point that Anna herself raises: what is the feeling trying to tell her? Is it saying that he has offended her by sending what seems to be more a friendship ring than an engagement ring? Is it saying that she is having doubts about the relationship? If she is fast approaching infertility, his dawdling is simply not defensible. It does not speak well of him. Now, Gottlieb will begin by advising either couples therapy or yet another conversation. As noted in the letter, the couple has already discussed the marriage question. More discussion will feel to the man like more pressure. For all we know he does not like to feel pressured and will only propose when he can feel as though he is taking the initiative. Gottlieb also counsels against laying down an ultimatum. She is quite correct. Ultimata never work, even when they seem to produce the right outcome. She recommends that the woman decide for herself how long she is going to put up with this. Again, a very good idea. At that point, the solution is to walk away, to walk out on her dawdling boyfriend. In Gottlieb�s words: Instead, the person you need to set boundaries with is yourself. How long are you willing to tolerate his ambivalence? At what point will you tell the part of you that�s willing to wait that waiting is taking too long�that you need to move forward and free yourself up to meet someone who wants what you do? The more open you are to this internal dialogue, the more likely you�ll be to do more than simply wait and see what your boyfriend does. Don�t make threats. Don�t lean in. Don�t exercise your will to power. But, tell yourself how long you are willing to wait, and if boyfriend does not propose, you should move out and move on.  A consequential action is worth far more than a series of conversations, even, or should I say, especially with a couples therapist. Regrettably, she is in very deep now, so it will not feel very good to walk away... because that will either involve walking out of her home or telling him to leave. It might have been better to have received a firmer commitment before setting up house together.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:38:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:38:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721869&p=4s5&v=1&x=X7f-r-ve5POEjg2rW6QTWg","commentsUrl":"http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8078379512095504946&postID=1628288831280251165","outboundUrls":["https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/01/my-boyfriend-gave-me-ring-he-didnt-propose/580768/"],"wordCount":"945","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721869","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"CHRISTMAS","score":"89"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"HOLIDAYS

Thus, creditors holding debt governed by English law can take comfort that the protections afforded by the rule remain intact, at least for the time being.BackgroundIn early 2017, International Bank of Azerbaijan (the \"Bank\") fell into financial difficulties and entered into a voluntary restructuring process under Azeri law. Following the commencement of this process, the Azeri officeholder, Ms Gunel Bakhshiyeva (as the foreign representative), applied to the English court for an order recognising the restructuring under the CBIR. The English court granted recognition to the Azeri restructuring process. This recognition gave rise to a moratorium pursuant to the CBIR which, among other things, protected the Bank from English court proceedings.In Azerbaijan, the Bank proposed a restructuring plan pursuant to which interests of certain creditors (which included the Respondents in this case) would be discharged in full and replaced with various other \"entitlements\". The plan was approved overwhelmingly by the creditors who voted on it and was sanctioned by the Azeri Court. As a matter of Azeri law, all dissenting creditors were bound by the plan, including the Respondents (whose lending to the Bank is governed by English law and who did not vote or otherwise participate in the restructuring process or submit to the jurisdiction of the Azeri Court).The Respondents indicated that once the restructuring process came to an end and the CBIR moratorium was lifted, they would seek to enforce their English law claims against the Bank in the English courts (contrary to the terms of the restructuring plan). This led to the Azeri officeholder making an application under Article 21 CBIR for an indefinite extension of the CBIR moratorium so that it would continue even after the Azeri restructuring came to an end and the Bank had resumed operation as a going concern. Article 21 provides that the English court can, where necessary to protect the interests of creditors, grant \"any appropriate relief\".The Respondents, relying on the rule in Gibbs, objected to the application and sought permission from the English court to bring proceedings against the Bank. The Bank accepted that the Court of Appeal was bound by the rule in Gibbs. Accordingly, it did not directly challenge the rule, though it reserved the right to do so if the case were to proceed to the Supreme Court. Instead it argued that the Court had the power to grant an indefinite moratorium pursuant to Article 21 CBIR and therefore, the rule was limited by the CBIR.At first instance3, Mr. Justice Hildyard refused the Bank's application but granted the Bank permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.Decision of the Court of AppealThe Court of Appeal, with Lord Justice Henderson giving the lead judgment, unanimously upheld the High Court's decision. The Court considered whether, pursuant to Article 21: it was appropriate to grant an indefinite moratorium which would prevent the Respondents from enforcing their English law rights pursuant to the rule in Gibbs; or prolong the moratorium after the end of the Azeri reconstruction.The Court held that it could only extend the moratorium (thus preventing the Respondents from enforcing their English law rights indefinitely) if this was necessary to protect the interests of the Bank's creditors; and was an appropriate way of achieving such protection4. The Court found that neither condition was satisfied.The creditors bound by the Azeri restructuring plan had received everything to which they were entitled, the Bank had resumed trading and the reconstruction was at an end. No further protection was required for the Azeri restructuring to achieve its purpose. It was material that the Bank could, in principle, have promoted a parallel scheme of arrangement in England in order to deal with the issue presented by the rule in Gibbs, but chose not to do so. Lord Justice Henderson surmised that the Bank likely did not adopt that approach because it would have had to treat the English creditors as a separate class and to offer them terms which they would be prepared to accept.Lord Justice Henderson noted that it could seldom, if ever, be appropriate to grant relief under the Model Law which would have the substantive effect of overriding the Respondents' English law rights as protected by the rule in Gibbs. The Court was bound by the Supreme Court's decision in Rubin v Eurofinance5 in which Lord Collins held that Article.21 was concerned with procedural matters and, although it should be given a purposive interpretation and widely construed, there was nothing to suggest that it applied to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments against third parties. Lord Justice Henderson could find nothing in Article 21 to suggest that the procedural power to grant a moratorium could properly be used to circumvent Gibbs and held that it would be wrong to use such powers, or any other provisions of the Model Law as incorporated in the CBIR, to circumvent the English law rights of the Respondents under the rule in Gibbs.Finally, the Court considered whether a stay could, in principle, prolong the moratorium after the end of the Azeri reconstruction. It held that it could not. Article 18 CBIR requires the foreign representative to promptly inform the English court of any substantial change in the status of the recognised foreign insolvency proceeding, or the status of the foreign representative's own appointment. This strongly implied that once the foreign proceeding has come to an end, and the foreign representative no longer holds office, there is no scope for further orders under the CBIR to be made, and any relief previously granted should terminate. Against that background, the Court it would be \"anomalous\" and inconsistent with the \"procedural and supportive\" role of the CBIR to allow a moratoruim to remain in place indefinitely.CommentCritics of Gibbs suggest that the rule is outdated and is inconsistent with the principles underlying the Model Law (on which the CBIR is based), which is intended to promote co-operation in cross-border insolvencies. The criticisms to which Gibbs has been subject were acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, however, the Court declined to discuss them in any detail given that all parties accepted that only the Supreme Court (or indeed the legislature) could overturn the rule. Notwithstanding any potential issues posed by the rule in Gibbs, the Court confirmed that the rule continues to apply in this jurisdiction and that the CBIR cannot be used to by-pass the protections it provides to creditors.In a speech6 given by Lord Neuberger in 2017 when he was President of the Supreme Court, he commented that there are \"powerful arguments\" for revisiting the Gibbs principle. Therefore, if this case does proceed to the Supreme Court, it may be that it will take the opportunity to re-consider the rule.One final point to note is that the case serves as an important reminder that creditors with English law governed rights will need to balance carefully the possible benefits of participating in a foreign insolvency proceeding as against what they might recover if they do not participate and instead seek to enforce their English law rights before the English court.Footnotes1 Antony Gibbs ...ns v La Socit Industrielle et Commerciale des Mtaux (1890) LR 25 QBD 3992 [2018] EWCA Civ 28023 [2018] EWHC 59 (Ch)4 Emphasis added.5 [2012] UKSC 466 International Insolvency Institute Annual Conference in London on 19 June 2017Visit us at mayerbrown.com[1]Mayer Brown is a global legal services provider comprising legal practices that are separate entities (the \"Mayer Brown Practices\").

Basics: Are There Any Steps I Need To Take Before Issuing A Claim?","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  What are the pre-action steps you need to consider before issuing a court claim and why does it matter?We set out the key points you need to know in order to avoid costly delays and sanctions.Can I issue a claim at any time?In simple terms, yes, but if you have not followed the required procedures and acted in a way that the court considers to be reasonable and proportionate, you may be penalised, even if your claim is successful.Potential sanctions are an adverse costs award (for example, an order that you pay your opponent's costs incurred as a result of you failing to comply with the prescribed rules), a stay of proceedings until relevant pre-action steps are completed and/or awards of interest up to 10% above base rate.In some cases, your contract will specify a process for dispute resolution and if that is the case, you need to follow the specified process in order to avoid a breach of contract. As an example, your contract may provide for arbitration, rather than litigation through the courts; equally, there might be a stepped process requiring the parties to engage in negotiations and/or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) (such as mediation) before commencing formal proceedings.There is the possibility that you will need to issue proceedings because the limitation period is due to end. In that case, you may be able to then agree a stay of proceedings with your opponent (or obtain an order from the court) to enable both parties to undertake pre-action steps, as described below.What pre-action steps do I need to take to protect my position?You need to comply with the pre-action rules that apply to your dispute in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) which apply to all civil court proceedings, and set out the steps that must be taken before an action is commenced. The CPR and pre-action rules are available online[1].There are specific protocols for certain areas of dispute (for example construction and engineering, professional negligence and certain debt claims); otherwise, the Practice Direction[2] on Pre-Action Conduct and Protocols (the PD) will apply. Check which rules will apply to your claim before proceeding.The CPR prescribe the steps that should ordinarily be taken before proceedings are commenced, by reference to the pre-action protocols or the PD. There are certain exceptions to the requirement to follow these rules, but in most cases, they will apply.What is the point of the pre-action rules?Overall, the intention behind the pre-action protocols and PD is to ensure that parties give full consideration to the strengths and weaknesses of their position before proceedings are commenced, leading (hopefully) to more resolutions at the pre-action stage and a reduction in legal costs that will be incurred.The rules aim to ensure that:sufficient information is exchanged (details of each party's position and possibly key documents) so that claims and defences are clear;the parties actively consider (and where appropriate take part in) alternative dispute resolution; andif proceedings are then commenced, the steps taken in compliance with the prescribed pre-action steps will assist in an efficient and cost-effective process going forward - for example, the issues between the parties may have been narrowed during the pre-action process.What are the main pre-action steps?The claimant sends a letter to the defendant setting out clear details of the claim and requiring a substantive response within a reasonable (specified) period of time.The defendant responds in writing, again with sufficient detail to set out clearly its position.Key documents are exchanged.The parties actively consider a without prejudice meeting and/or a mediation - one or both of these may then take place.As is evident from the steps listed above, you will need to have a clear understanding of your claim at the pre-action stage, including the amount of the claim and what you consider to be the basis of the entitlement. You will also need to have collated relevant documents and information.Remember throughout that in due course, you may need to evidence the fact that you have acted reasonably and proportionately in relation to your claim.Other pre-action considerationsOver and above the applicable pre-action steps, you should ensure that you have carefully considered the potential risks and benefits of court proceedings before committing to a formal process.Consider your overall strategy and goals, taking into account the time commitment needed and the level of legal costs that will be incurred, a substantial portion of which are likely to be irrecoverable, even if you succeed at trial.Bear in mind the potentially irrecoverable management costs of being involved in a formal dispute, an issue covered in more detail in our article on contractual damages[3].Review funding options for costs, the likelihood of success, and balance the potential gains of litigation against the possible benefits of an early pragmatic settlement which will give conclusivity and remove the risk of an adverse outcome.Even before the pre-action requirements take effect, consider the possibility of making an early offer of settlement by way of a CPR Part 36 offer, \"without prejudice\" negotiations and/or mediation.Failure to follow the prescribed actions and steps before starting proceedings can end up needlessly costing your business both time and money.The pre-action process may appear cumbersome but use it to your advantage by pro-actively seeking an advantageous resolution. Even if you end up having to issue a claim, you will have taken steps to protect your position on costs as you will be able to evidence your committed attempts to reach a settlement, or at least narrow down the issues in dispute at an early stage.Read the original article on GowlingWLG.com[4]The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

UCB Pharma GMBH[2]. In this article, I look at the lead compound analysis that led the USPTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to uphold the claims against an obviousness challenge, including a factor that doesn't always get much attention.The Patent At IssueThe patent at issue was UCB's U.S. Patent 6,858,650, which claims the active ingredient of Toviaz (fesoterodine), an antimuscarinic drug used to treat urinary incontinence. Fesoterodine is a prodrug of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), which itself is a metabolite of tolterodine, which is the active ingredient of Detrol, an antimuscarinic drug used to treat overactive bladder.The PTAB's Lead Compound AnalysisThe patent was challenged in an Inter Partes Review (IPR) proceeding originally brought by Mylan, and joined by Amerigen and two others after institution. At issue was whether it would have been obvious to modify 5-HMT to arrive at fesoterodine.The PTAB cited the Federal Circuit decision in Otsuka Pharm. Co., Ltd., v. Sandoz, Inc., 678 F.3d 1280 Fed. Cir. 2012), as setting forth a \"two prong inquiry\" for determining whether a new chemical compound would have been obvious:whether one of ordinary skill would have selected one or more lead compounds for further development and,whether the prior art would have supplied sufficient motivation to modify a lead compound to arrive at the compound claimed with a reasonable expectation of success.This framework is referred to as a \"lead compound analysis.\"As summarized in the PTAB's Final Written Decision, Petitioners asserted that it would have been obvious for one of ordinary skill in the art to:identify 5-HMT as a lead compound for drug development;recognize that 5-HMT could have adverse effects due to its metabolism and poor oral bioavailability due to its lipophilicity profileaddress such concerns regarding adverse effects and poor oral bioavailability by esterifying 5-HMT to create a prodrug having increased lipophilicity and, subsequently, optimizing the ester moiety toarrive at a compound having a short-chain mono-ester derivative at only the5-hydroxyl position; andselect an acid-addition salt that provides the desired product stability.The PTAB agreed with Petitioners on the first point, but disagreed that they had shown that there would have been a motivation to modify HMT, as asserted for the second point. In particular, the PTAB found that Petitioners had not shown that the CYP2D6 metabolism known to occur with tolterodine was a concern for HMT, or that HMT would have been expected to exhibit poor bioavailability.The PTAB also disagreed that a person of ordinary skill would have pursued a prodrug of HMT. On this point, it credited Patent Owner's argument that developing a prodrug can be more complicated than developing a drug:As Patent Owner points out, and as we agree, \"prodrug development requires monitoring the toxicity, bioavailability, receptor affinity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of not only one, but two, compounds - the prodrug and the desired active compound - making the development process even more complex, time consuming, and expensive.\"Further, the PTAB found \"inadequate evidence in the record\" that the prior art \"would have suggested making the specific molecular modification necessary to achieve fesoterodine.\" Rather, the PTAB credited the testimony of Patent Owner's expert regarding \"[t]he sheer number of possibilities available to the person of ordinary skill in the art at each stage of the process.\" On this point, the PTAB was \"not persuaded\" by Petitioners' arguments \"that it would have been 'routine optimization' to test all 86 possible phenolic esters, particularly in view of the inventors' testimony in the district court litigation that those experiments yielded unpredictable results.\"Even on the last point, which Petitioners supported by citation to Berge et al., Pharmaceutical Salts, 66(1) J. PHARM. SCI. 1-19 (1977), the PTAB was persuaded by Patent Owner's evidence of the unpredictability of identifying a suitable salt of fesoterodine in particular. The PTAB noted that \"the inventor of the '650 patent screened more than 70 salts of fesoterodine,\" but discovered \"only two viable stable, pure, and crystalline salt forms.\" (The Federal Circuit did not address this finding, on the basis that it was \"not necessary to the Board's judgment\".)Thus, the PTAB determined that the Petitioners had not carried their burden of demonstrating obviousness.The Federal Circuit's Lead Compound AnalysisThe Federal Circuit decision was authored by Judge Lourie and joined by Judges Chen and Stoll.Before addressing the PTAB's decision on the merits, the Federal Circuit noted that it reviews the PTAB's factual findings for \"substantial evidence,\" which only requires that \"a reasonable mind might accept the evidence as adequate to support the finding.\" With that standard of review in mind, the Federal Circuit found no error in how the PTAB weighed conflicting expert testimony or in the conclusions reached.Considering the first prong of the PTAB's lead compound analysis, the Federal Circuit expressly commented on the PTAB's decision that \"a person of ordinary skill would have considered prodrug development to involve trade-offs,\" and found no error in the PTAB determination \"that a person of ordinary skill would not have turned to a prodrug approach 'to solve an undefined problem.'\"Considering the second prong of the PTAB's lead compound analysis, the Federal Circuit found the PTAB decision rested on three main findings:Petitioners presented no evidence that an ester of 5-HMT would be inactive, as required for a prodrug.Petitioners did not point to any prodrugs analogous to 5-HMT (e.g., \"in the same chemical class, with the same mechanism of action, or in the same field of treatment\")It would not have been routine to make the claimed molecular modifications to 5-HMT to produce the claimed compounds.On the first two points, the Federal Circuit drew a line between requiring Petitioners to prove those points and finding \"the absence of such evidence\" to supported non-obviousness. On the third point, the court noted: Any compound may look obvious once someone has made it and found it to be useful, but working backwards from that compound, with the benefit of hindsight, once one is aware of it does not render it obvious. Thus, the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB decision.A Fresh Look at the Lead Compound AnalysisOne thing I found interesting about this case was the issue raised under the first prong of the lead compound analysis-whether there was a motivation to modify HMT. Often the issue under this prong is whether the cited prior art compound[3] would have been viewed as a \"lead\" compound, with motivation to improve the prior art compound being assumed.Another thing interesting about this case is the argument that the existence of a patent on HMT in and of itself would have motivated a person of ordinary skill to develop a different compound. The PTAB dismissed this argument based on its \"untimely development,\" the \"absence of factual underpinnings,\" and the \"lack of legal precedent. The Federal Circuit also gave it short shrift, because \"even accepting, for the sake of discussion, that a patent on 5-HMT would provide a commercial motivation for a skilled artisan to modify 5-HMT,\" Amerigen still had to show that the \"specific molecular modifications\" were obvious.KSR imbued a person of ordinary skill in the art with \"ordinary creativity.\" Will a person of ordinary skill in the art next be defined as having an ordinary profit motive?The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Chairman Joe Simons and Commissioner Christine Wilson returned to the FTC as commissioners after years of private practice, and other major Commission roles have been filled by FTC alumni. Similarly, the Antitrust Division leadership has a number of attorneys with prior government experience.This seasoned leadership, however, has not made antitrust enforcement more predictable. This uncertainty is even more pronounced in \"vertical\" deals involving companies that are at different levels of the supply chain. Both FTC and DOJ spoke out early in the Trump administration against behavioral remedies which have been used in the past to mitigate risk of harm to competition from vertical deals.1Absent imposing behavioral remedies like those in Comcast/ NBCU, the Division, for example challenged the proposed vertical transaction involving AT...nd Time Warner. This uncertainty is also present in horizontal deals involving direct competitors: some deals are getting inquiries where none were expected and some are being cleared when we expected inquiries.On a more positive note, both the FTC and Antitrust Division have focused on process improvements. In response to increasing time, expense and burden of government antitrust investigations, both agencies have announced initiatives to speed up the review process for proposed mergers.2Several major retail mergers made headlines in 2018 and provide lessons for merging parties in 2019.J.M. Smucker's attempted acquisition of the Wesson cooking oil brand from Conagra was abandoned by the parties after the FTC challenged the merger. The FTC alleged that the combined Smucker's, which already owns the Crisco brand, would control at least 70 percent of the market for branded canola and vegetable oils sold to grocery stores and other retailers. The FTC also alleged that Smucker's own documents showed that eliminating price competition between Wesson and Crisco was a central part of the rationale for the deal. Interestingly, the FTC did not include private label cooking oils in its relevant market definition despite the fact that private label products account for a majority of cooking oil sales to retail consumers. Three days after the FTC filed for a preliminary injunction, the parties abandoned the dealAT... acquisition of Time Warner was challenged by the Department of Justice in late 2017. After a full trial on the merits of the proposed acquisition, federal district court Judge Richard Leon approved the deal in June 2018 and the parties closed on the transaction soon thereafter. After initially saying that it would not challenge Judge Leon's decision, the DOJ appealed to the DC Circuit. AT...as agreed to hold the Turner Networks (such as CNN, TNT, TBS and HLN) separate from the rest of its operations until February 28, 2019, and the parties have sought expedited treatment for the appeals process.With two major mergers now facing additional scrutiny, 2019 is sure to bring additional drama to the antitrust landscape in the retail sector.Footnote1 Asst.

The answer to this question is more complex than it sounds, and requires a fair amount of research at your firm. Asking this straight up is like asking what the bill for dinner will be before you�ve even decided what you�re going to have. Obviously, if you have a firm constraint, that�s your budget. If the CFO says you have X dollars and says no use case or business case can change that, then that�s your budget. But let�s explore making a case.

We hear this question a lot during this time of year because marketers are facing new strategies, new plans, and of course, new budgets. And the answer to this question is a lot more complicated than it sounds. It requires a fair amount of research on your part requires some market research and requires understanding the goals everything that goes into marketing asking this question straight up like this is like asking, what�s the bill for dinner going to be before you even decided what you�re going to have? We�re going to go or are asking the doctor, what�s my budget for surgery and doctors like whoa, we don�t even know what�s wrong it so how do we approach budgeting? How do you approach marketing budgets if you have a firm constraint Now, obviously if the CFO says Hey, you got $10,000. That�s all I can spare. You know, that�s that�s literally all we�ve got in in the can and says there�s no use case or business case at all, you know, we have what we have done that too. But that�s that�s pretty straightforward that�s probably the easiest and unfortunately the most difficult type of budget to work with because there is no flexibility on on the part of the company and that that happens. The second question to ask if there is flexibility or if you�ve been asked, hey, what should the budget be? The question is, what are the goals? What are the goals that the company is trying to achieve? If the CEO has said hey, this year we got have 15% growth year over year or 15% revenue growth that�s when you can start to back into what your budget will be. Because if you think about your marketing operations follow you have revenue from existing customers revenue from new customers, which you have sales deals closed You have sales deals. And then you have opportunities and proposals and you have leads, you have prospects you have audience. And if you layer this funnel together and you put all your analytics together, you can reverse engineer work backwards to what each layer of your funnel brings in revenue and then what it costs for that. So for example, if you do this whole process, let�s say sales worth $1,000 and you do everything and you find out that eventually a lead is worth $10 and a website visitors worth $1 because it takes 10 website visitors to get to one lead in that example, if you know that a visitor is worth $1, you know the end and the CEO said 15% revenue growth then you need you�re going to need 15% more of everything to get to That that 15% growth. So what does it cost you to get qualified web traffic and whatever that is, say it�s, you know, $5 visit because you make it up on the customer lifetime value down the road, then, you know, you�re going to need 15% more of that every day, every week, every month every year, and you can give them a budget and save, it costs us $10,000 this year is going to cost us $11,500 to get you the amount of traffic that you need in order to hit that 15% revenue goal. Right. So that�s a case where there�s a revenue goal and you can reverse engineer your marketing to your costs to figure out what you�re going to meet for a budget. If the goals aren�t clear for the company that that�s a separate problem. But you can benchmark off of what similar companies charge for users their marketing budget. So if you are not familiar with the CMO survey, it�s offensive. Twice a year survey released by Duke University. And I think one of the big consulting firms, I can�t remember which one and they release interviews with 500 CMOS and talk about major things like budgeting. So let�s go over and take a look here since 2012, which is one of the first question, the question was first asked, What is marketing spending as a percentage of company revenue we�ve seen that been as high as 11%. And then the most recent one of August 2018, about 7.3%. So if the company�s overall revenues are, you know, $100,000 or a million dollars, or $10 million or a billion dollars, the marketing budget, the spending is 7.3% of that and then we can go down and this is a fat but it�s a fantastic resource just to read in general, but you can see by category b2b spends 5.4% beat b2b product be to be service 7.1% B to C product 10%. BB services 8.9%. And so if you�re looking at the overall top line budget, that this gives you a good sense of what is the spend calibrated was the industry average for your sector. And you can download the detailed data for specific industries to find your vertical, you can see like some of them, like internet sales or education is a top spender in that category. So that�s a way to get at the top line number if your company�s goals are just flat out, not clear. Now, one of the challenges with this approach is that this gives you the overall top line budget, you know, companies companies going to spend 10% of their revenue on marketing. Well, great. If your company�s hundred million dollars you can spend $10 million on marketing. How would you calibrate that? How do you turn that into something that�s more channel specific? The way to do that is with attribution analysis. And you need to have really good attribution analysis in order To say, this is what we should allocate our budget based on the impact of each given channel. So let me show you an example of an attribution analysis. This is one done using machine learning to type of machine learning called Markov chains. And what it does is you run it against something like your Google Analytics data to say, like, where do our conversions come from, and it will mix and match all the different channels and steps that people take based on your existing data. And Kelly played digital Jenga with them to understand like this channel results, it always causes conversion or this channel never causes conversion. And by doing this a few million times with your data you get a sense of this is the impact of that channel. So in this case, for this particular example, this customers organic search, 19.7% of conversions were strongly impacted by organic search if I�m trying to figure out but budget and guess what 19.7% of my budgets going to go to organic search work to SEO work to make to make it work better, and enter to keep that channel strong email 12.8%. So again, if I�m trying to figure out what to spend now, if I�ve got $100,000 and I want to spend, you know, $12,870 on email, email service provider fees, that is people time that is creative. So when you do your marketing budget, you do have to account for all the different costs and figure how to allocate that that budgets not just hard dollars, you want to allocate people time this as well. Then there�s Twitter, Facebook, and so on and so forth. So attribution analysis will then help you take that marketing budget, whatever the dollar amount you get is and slice it up according to the different channels and allocated appropriately. This is all thing that you can do, you can use machine learning to a very sophisticated way. But you can even do it with built in tools in Google Analytics and not as good, but they�re okay. And they�re certainly better than just guessing. So what�s the right marketing budget? The last consideration is if there�s a strategic imperative that requires you to do things differently, to say, Hey, we�re going to grow our audience on Facebook, or we�re going to grow our referral traffic, or we know that the industry is moving to voice search. And so we�re going to double down on SEO, do the activation analysis and then manipulate the numbers, push them say, okay, we�re going to we�re going to 719 percent of organic search, we�re going to go to 22%, and that extra 3% is going to go towards organic search towards Voice Search. We�re going to make that I think so that�s the last factor in this is there�s a strategic imperative that will have to override some of the calculations but you want to start with these calculations first. So that you can then make sensible adjustments and maybe even pull from certain channels because at the end of the day, you still have that same pile of money you�re working with. So really good question, a very complex question that will take you some time to do this. It will take you time and effort to do the calculations. But if you do them well, you�ll use your market marketing budget. Well, you will invest smartly in in your marketing and you�ll get the best possible result with the resources you have.

Dentro de todas las dinmicas para asegurar el buen manejo de los residuos que ocasione la celebraci�n cat�lica, se encuentran los ecobalboas, una iniciativa nacida en Costa Rica, bajo el nombre de ecolones, y que aprovechando el multitudinario encuentro, entran al istmo para presentarles a los paname�os una forma de ahorrar y contribuir con el ambiente. Los ecobalboas son una moneda virtual con la que cada participante podr llevar los distintos materiales de residuo -limpios, secos y separados- a los centros de acopio, y canjearlos por esta moneda que le brindar descuentos en los distintos comercios participantes en este programa. La directora de este proyecto, Karla Chaves, comenta que esta iniciativa naci� de la b�squeda por hacer que ms personas se involucren en el tema ambiental, as como lograr una alianza p�blica y privada en contra del mal manejo de los residuos, que no solo representa un mal negocio para muchos empresarios, sino un peligro para la sociedad en general. denied:javascript:void(0) Expandir Imagen[3] Karla Chaves, directora de este proyecto. Alexander Arosemena C�mo funcionan los ecobalboas? El consumidor en casa hace su proceso de consumo y separaci�n de los materiales de residuo. Despus los lleva al centro de acopio, que es el actor clave de este proceso, listo para recibirlo con calculadoras que le dirn cuntos ecobalboas ganar. El cliente se lleva su ecomoneda y puede ir viendo cunto va ganando, como un programa de lealtad. Despus estn los comercios. Muchas de estas empresas ya son las que fabrican estos materiales. Son las que completan el crculo. Las empresas pagan los incentivos a los consumidores que empezaron el proceso. Es importante recalcar que son descuentos. No se puede comprar artculos. Cul es el objetivo que se desea alcanzar? Aparte del tema ambiental y econ�mico, lo vemos como la manera de premiar a los que participan en la primera etapa del reciclaje, que es la separaci�n. Por qu Panam? Cuando iniciamos ecolones hace nueve meses, recibimos muchos correos de Panam por parte de personajes de la poltica, la salud y los negocios. Sumado a eso, las cantidades de residuos que se manejan en Costa Rica y Panam son muy similares, as que vimos a Panam como una forma de ir probando c�mo vamos adaptando este proyecto a diferentes realidades. Ya que aunque ecolones naci� en Costa Rica, no es solo para nosotros, sino para el mundo. Queramos compartir esta experiencia, porque todos estamos detrs de una soluci�n sobre el tema de los residuos. Por qu durante la JMJ? Vimos la JMJ como un buen momento por dos razones: primero, porque vienen muchos ticos a Panam y la comunidad tica tiene una sensibilidad grande con el ambiente, as que queremos utilizarlos como embajadores de nuestro mensaje. En segundo lugar, la JMJ es una oportunidad de educaci�n. La encclica Laudato Si de 2015 del papa Francisco, est dedicada al tema ambiental y combatir la cultura del descarte. C�mo combate con esta iniciativa la cultura del descarte? Lo hacemos dignificando la labor de los centros de acopio y de todos los que trabajan en esta industria. Estamos rescatando materiales para no hacer ms extracci�n innecesaria de la naturaleza. Tenemos que cuidar la casa com�n sin importar la religi�n o pas. El cambio climtico tiene que ver con nuestro tema tambin, porque los residuos son la tercera causa del efecto invernadero. Cules son los centro de acopio en Panam? Por el momento contamos con: Red Ecol�gica, S. A. (La Locera, Tumba Muerto); FAS Panam (Ciudad del Saber, Clayton); Instituto Tcnico Don Bosco (va Israel, San Francisco); Recimetal Panam, S.A. (Calidonia); Cooperativa de Servicios Pro Ambiente (Villa Crdenas, Las Cumbres); Panama Recycling (Llano Bonito). Se pueden usar los ecobalboas en Costa Rica? S. Una vez tenga su cuenta y sus ecobalboas, puede hacer una conversi�n de esta moneda virtual paname�a a ecolones y aprovechar los descuentos en los locales participantes en Costa Rica, y viceversa. En qu otros pases planean incursionar? Pr�ximamente estaremos en Per�, luego seguir Guatemala, despus a Jamaica, Colombia y Argentina.

The purpose of this report is to provide a quick download of market trends, actionable insights for decision-makers and to keep our readers ahead of the curve on where the cross-border market is heading.A primer for the new U.S. anti-hybrid rulesOn December 20, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury Department) released eagerly anticipated proposed regulations designed to combat the use of cross-border hybrid financing arrangements. These regulations, issued under new Section 267A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are aimed at preventing the use of arrangements involving hybrid transactions or hybrid entities to affirmatively exploit differences in the tax laws across jurisdictions. This regulatory proposal represents a game-changing escalation of the U.S. tax system's commitment to neutralize the use of hybrid arrangements that erode the U.S. tax base. What you need to know about these new rules and their application[1]CPTPP implemented in Canada: Opportunities and challenges for Canadian businessesOn December 30, 2018, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) was implemented as between Canada, Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore. Once fully implemented, the CPTPP will create a trading bloc made up of almost half a billion consumers and representing 13.5% of the global GDP. We outline some of the key provisions of the CPTPP and why this presents some immense opportunities as well as challenges for Canadian businesses. Why Canadian businesses should review their strategies[2]Legal Year in Review: From cannabis to U.S. tax reformThe cross-border business landscape in 2018 saw a number of major legal developments that are reshaping the way Canadians conduct and execute their cross-border business strategies. From Canada becoming the first G7 country to legalize retail cannabis mdash; and Canadian cannabis companies conquering U.S. capital markets mdash; to U.S. tax reform and more, we offer insights on the key things Canadians should be cognizant of.

MPs to vote on Macedonia name change","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Greek lawmakers are due to vote Friday on a deal to change the name of neighbouring Macedonia and resolve a diplomatic dispute that has dragged on for nearly 30 years.The vote was originally scheduled for after midnight Thursday but had to be postponed to Friday because some 230 lawmakers wanted to speak on the issue, the parliament speaker said.Hundreds opposed to the deal protested outside parliament on Thursday evening, with police using tear gas to disperse them.The vote on the agreement to rename Macedonia as the Republic of North Macedonia is now planned for around 2:30 pm (1230 GMT). \"Tomorrow is a crucial vote... now is the time to break free of the vicious cycle of nationalism and look at... future cooperation,\" Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told the chamber.Macedonia's parliament on January 11 backed a constitutional revision to change the country's name but for the deal to go through, it must also be approved by Greek MPs.Communist party activists Thursday draped giant banners outside the Acropolis, the ancient citadel on an rocky outcrop overlooking Athens, reading: \"No to the Tsipras-Zaev agreement.\"That was a reference to the landmark compromise agreed in June between Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev.On Sunday, clashes between police and masked protesters left around 40 people injured as tens of thousands demonstrated in Athens against the name change. According to the government, \"the incidents were provoked by extremists, members of (neo-Nazi party) Golden Dawn, who attempted to enter parliament\".A wide range of Greek political parties, from Golden Dawn to the Socialists, oppose the accord.But it could nonetheless be approved by the required 151 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament.The accord aims to start unravelling a diplomatic dispute that began nearly three decades ago with Macedonia's declaration of independence but whose roots date back centuries.Since 1991, Athens has objected to its neighbour being called Macedonia because Greece has a northern province of the same name. In ancient times it was the cradle of Alexander the Great's empire, a source of intense pride for Greeks.But the June agreement marks a landmark shift in the dispute, with the efforts of the two prime ministers winning them a nomination for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.- 'Right side of history' -In addition to normalising relations between the two countries, implementation of the agreement will open the door for Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO, hitherto blocked by Athens' veto.But in Greece, its neighbour's name continues to fuel controversy in politics and society, a few months ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October. Last week, Tsipras's ruling coalition fell apart as a result of the controversy but he then narrowly won a confidence vote, setting the stage for the name-change vote in parliament.His leftist Syriza party has 145 MPs and enough independent members have pledged their support to secure approval of the deal.On the right, New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the agreement \"creates new problems\" and \"awakens nationalism\".\"Your foreign policy is superficial and ignorant... you should be ashamed,\" he told leftist lawmakers.\"Are you afraid of a state that does not even have two percent of our military capability and not even six percent of our economic output?,\" former foreign minister Nikos Kotzias, who was one of the top architects of the June agreement, asked the MPs. Macedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov, who worked with him on the deal, told AFP the compromise had created \"a climate (in which) the impossible is actually possible\".For many Greeks, especially in the north where the province of Macedonia is the birthplace of Alexander, the name \"Macedonia\" belongs to Greek historical heritage.But Tsipras insisted Thursday: \"We never had a Macedonian language. Alexander the Great spoke Greek.\"If the agreement does not come into effect, \"the consequences of the failure will be profound\" and reaching a new deal \"would take years, not months\", UN mediator Matthew Nimetz warned in an interview with Greek news agency ANA.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:43Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721191&p=4s5&v=1&x=06_ewbBs1t-TG-7B_B7gIA","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"706","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

E poi non si pu� costruire una lista unitaria dicendo a priori chi deve farne parte e chi no� . Lo afferma Laura Boldrini (Leu) in una intervista a Repubblica nella quale spiega che bisogna �scongiurare� un'ammucchiata. \n Serve uno sforzo di aggregazione  \n�Ma proprio per questo occorre fare chiarezza e rispondere a una domanda precisa: si vuol fare una lista per chi ha gi� votato Pd alle ultime elezioni? Oppure si vuole allargare rivolgendosi a chi ha fatto altre scelte oppure si � astenuto?� , si chiede. �Nel primo caso - commenta l'ex presidente della Camera - sarebbe un progetto modesto e autoreferenziale che non andrebbe molto lontano. E' necessario uno sforzo di aggregazione di tutte le culture progressiste cos� da attrarre anche quelle realt� che non voterebbero gli attuali partiti� . \nZedda: Fronte unito per vincere contro sovranisti  \n�Calenda mi ha chiesto di firmare l'appello. L'ho ringraziato ma io ora sono impegnato con le Regionali e se l'avessi fatto ci sarebbe stata una fibrillazione nella coalizione. Questo dibattito sulle Europee lo avrei spostato pi� in l�, quando il segretario del Pd fosse stato eletto ad esempio� . A parlare, in una intervista a Repubblica, � Massimo Zedda, sindaco di Cagliari e candidato alla presidenza della Regione Sardegna con uno schieramento di centrosinistra che va dal Pd a Campo Progressista, a Leu, al movimento di Federico Pizzarotti. \n Bene la lista di Calenda per le Europee?  \n�Non sono mai per dire agli altri cosa devono fare. Centrale � il progetto. Con o senza i simboli dei partiti. Per le Europee auspicherei un simbolo comune. Oggi � come quando sotto i bombardamenti suonavano le sirene. Stanno suonando da mesi e mesi con il governo di Salvini e di Di Maio� . Comunque, conclude Zedda, �dobbiamo ricomporre la sinistra e avere la capacit� di parlare ai moderati preoccupati da questo Governo� .","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:43Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721197&p=4s5&v=1&x=VbJ1br2G0JDX_w0c4d9Icw","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"328","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721197","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://archivi.diariodelweb.it/img/og/536/536885-facebook-1000x500.jpg"},{"url":"https://archivi.diariodelweb.it/img/140/536/536885-995x524.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Politics","score":"92"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"13985","name":"Diariodel Web","homeUrl":"http://www.diariodelweb.it","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Italy","countryCode":"IT","region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"5.10","pageAuthority":"51.00","domainAuthority":"55.00","externalLinks":"5097","links":"77026"}},"feed":{"id":"173076104","name":"Diariodel Web","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940750673","id":"38350721206","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"UK's Hammond suggests EU may move on Brexit deal","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  British finance minister Philip Hammond said Friday he believed the EU might compromise over a Brexit deal in a way that would persuade lawmakers in London to support it.\"I don't think the European Union is going to change its fundamental position around the backstop\", a controversial provision in the deal relating to Ireland, Hammond told BBC radio from the World Economic Forum in Davos.\"But what I hear from European politicians and commentators that I've talked to here in Davos is that there is a process going on of thinking very hard about where the EU has drawn its red lines, whether they really need to be in the place where they have been drawn.\"The House of Commons last week rejected the EU withdrawal deal struck by Prime Minister Theresa May with Brussels, leaving Britain without a plan and Brexit day looming on March 29.May has been speaking to her Conservative MPs and her Northern Irish allies to establish what changes might convince them to support the agreement, before restarting talks with Brussels.The MPs are mostly concerned about the backstop, an arrangement that would potentially keep Britain aligned to the EU's trade rules indefinitely as a way to keep open the border with Ireland.Hammond said he did not believe the backstop could be entirely removed but noted many MPs would accept a time-limit, or a guarantee that Britain could exit it in some circumstances.He repeated his opposition to Britain leaving the EU without a deal, saying it would be \"an extremely bad outcome for the UK economy\".MPs will on Tuesday vote on a series of amendments designed to avoid this option, notably by seeking to delay Brexit if there is no agreement reached.Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has hinted she could resign if she and other Conservative MPs were not allowed a free vote next week.But Hammond said: \"What Amber is doing is reflecting a view among some of my colleagues that somehow next Tuesday is high noon, the last chance to make a stand against no deal. I don't think that is the case.\"","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:43Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721206&p=4s5&v=1&x=pWiqd4JkX2IVSjRl46S47g","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"350","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

Autobahn speed limit 'could save lives,' police union says","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  Proposals to impose speed limits on Germany's highways has divided the country. But the German police union believes it's time to hit the brakes because the situation \"is crazy.\"The deputy leader of the German Police Officers' Union, Michael Mertens, on Friday backed proposals to impose a general speed limit on Germany's famed Autobahn in an interview with the S�ddeutsche Zeitung daily.Recent proposals by a government commission on the future of mobility to impose restrictions triggered a heated debate across the country. What Mertens said: \"We are the only country in Europe that has no general speed limit on highways\" \"In this country, some people legally drive 200 or 250 km/h (155 mph). To be clear, that is crazy\" \"Studies show one in four road deaths could be prevented with a speed limit.\" \"Reducing the speed to 130 km/h would prevent long tailbacks and serious traffic accidents.\" Read more: Will Germany use autobahn speed limits to cut carbon emissions?A German stapleA proposal on restrictions was formulated by a government commission looking at ways to combat climate change. It suggested that by imposing a speed limit, Germany could significantly reduce air pollution. However, for many in and outside Germany, the speed limit-free highways are a German staple. Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said this week that the idea of a speed limit \"defies all common sense.\"However, others have defended the proposal. Green Party lawmaker Cem Ozdemir this week defended a speed limit, saying it represented an \"act of reason.\"Read more: Autobahn deaths prompt calls to punish rubberneckersWhat is the current situation in Germany and Europe?Germany is the only country in Europe with no official speed limit on highways. However, there are restrictions on some stretches, especially in and around cities and in roadworks. Germany's neighbors Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, France and the Czech Republic all impose a 130 km/h limit. In Belgium and Switzerland, it sinks to 120 km/h.Read more: Germans shocked by Autobahn privatization planWhat happens next?The commission examining the proposal is expected to publish the documents by the end of March.Read more: Europe's patchy approach to road tollsEvery evening, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

Its BigBattery project will help balance fluctuations in electricity generation.Just little over an hour's drive from Berlin in a southeast direction lands you dead in the middle of Eastern Germany's lignite mining area.With roughly a quarter of the reunited nation's required electricity coming from coal, the open-cast mines here still have a vital role to play in the national energy mix, although environmentalists would argue the transition to more renewables is not happening fast enough.People at the Schwarze Pumpe [Black Pump] power station here in Eastern Germany's Lusatia region know that the days of coal-fired plants may be numbered, but sober-minded experts say they seem safe for the next 10 to 15 years.New-generation plantSchwarze Pumpe is a very modern coal-fired plant which started operating in 1997 to eventually boast two 800 megawatt blocks of installed power, raising the bar both in terms of efficiency and low emissions for new generation coal-fired power stations.It achieves an energy conversion efficiency of 40 degrees, meaning less coal has to be used to produce the same amount of electricity, and hence lower CO2 emissions.But the rise of renewables seems unstoppable in a nation that has made the transition to greener energy a major policy goal and made the phasing out of nuclear energy irrevocable.The trend is clear. Back in 2009, just 16 percent of all electricity generated in the country came from renewables. Just five years later, they already accounted for 27.3 percent, while in 2017 their share of total electricity output amounted to 33 percent.There's a snagOne of the downsides of relying a lot more on renewables � with the focus in Germany being on wind � is that dependence on weather conditions increases. When, say, there's less wind and less sun for that matter, resulting fluctuations in electricity supplies to the national grid have to be compensated in some way to head off power outages.German transmission system operators are responsible for maintaining the balance between electricity generation and actual demand (consumption) around the clock.Registered imbalances on a lower scale are first compensated between the various operators in a process that's come to be known as imbalance netting. But oftentimes, that may not suffice.What kicks in then is a sophisticated system of additional control power procurement and more often than not the activation of the so-called primary control reserve, meaning that additional electricity is fed into the grid by power stations and other market actors, with procurement ensured and rewarded through a competitive bidding process among potential suppliers.Primary load balancing in focusThis brings us back to the Schwarze Pumpe power plant in Lusatia. Its operator, LEAG, has announced that Czech contractor EGEM and local service companies are planning to build a huge battery storage facility hooked up the coal-fired plant to reach a storage capacity of 53 megawatts, making it the biggest of its kind in Europe and helping to ensure smooth grid operation.\"The combination of existing power plant infrastructure and battery storage technology is unique in Europe, and so will be its start-of-life capacity,\" LEAG spokesperson Kathi Gerstner told DW.\"I'm not aware of any other comparable project of that size in Europe,\" she added.LEAG is investing �25 million ($28.8 million) in the lithium-ion storage facility comprising 13 containers full of battery racks and spreading across an area the size of a soccer pitch.The German state of Brandenburg, where LEAG is headquartered, takes �4 million of total investments. The storage facility will be operational by the summer of 2020.Australia leading the wayLEAG CEO Hubertus Altmann said BigBattery Lusatia, as the project is called, was an investment in the future. \"In order to stabilize the grid, we'll be using the facility on days where electricity generation fluctuations are high due to renewables.\"Gerstner confirmed that \"the main use of the facility would be to provide primary load balancing electricity which the market pays for.\"By the way, the 100 megawatt/129 megawatt per hour Hornsdale Power Reserve in Australia is currently the world's largest lithium-ion battery storage facility. It covers about 1 hectare of land and is located at the Hornsdale Wind Farm, South Australia's largest generator of renewable energy.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:43Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721213&p=4s5&v=1&x=d_-Yp7V4p7aM43LkFC6c_g","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"772","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

\"Other Insurance Clauses\": Can One Trump The Other?","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In TD General Insurance Company v. Intact Insurance Company, 2019 ONCA 5, the Court of Appeal considered whether one insurer's \"other insurance clause\" could trump the other's.Both policies provided coverage for the loss and contained identically worded clauses making their policies excess to any other insurance which applied to the loss. The Court found that the identical clauses made the two policies irreconcilable and so the two insurers must share the burden equally under a coordinate obligation to make good the loss.The Loss, Policies and Lower Court's DecisionThe loss in this case arose out of a boating accident. The injured passenger sued the driver of the boat who was covered by two policies of insurance � the boat owner's TD policy and the driver's own homeowner's policy, issued by Intact. Both policies contained an \"other insurance clause\" that provided:If you have other insurance which applies to a loss or claim, or would have applied if this policy did not exist, this policy will be considered excess insurance and we will not pay any loss or claim until the amount of such other insurance is used up.TD brought an application seeking an order that both insurance companies were on an equal footing and had to share equally in the defence and indemnity of the driver.In the lower court decision, the court found that although both policies provided coverage for this loss, TD exhibited a clear intention to treat its policy as the primary insurance due to its specific reference to the boat in question thus making it the \"closest to the risk\".The Court Of Appeal Disagrees and Sets Out the FrameworkThe Court of Appeal disagreed with this approach. In applying the principles of the Supreme Court's decision in Family Insurance Corp. v. Lombard Canada Ltd., 2002 SCC 48, the Panel set out the following two-part analysis:Is there overlapping coverage?It must first be confirmed that both policies provide coverage for the loss at issue. If a policy does not provide coverage, then there is no need to consider competing \"other insurance clauses.\" In this case, both policies provided coverage.Did the insurers intended to limit their obligation to contribute, by what method, and in what circumstances vis--vis the insured?The focus in answering this question is on the excess insurance clauses. Both policies, by their terms, afforded primary coverage to the driver for the loss, and both policies provided that they were excess to other insurance that covered the loss thus the limiting obligations in the policies were irreconcilable.The Panel ultimately concluded that the two insurers must share the burden of defence and indemnity of the driver equally.

I confess that I do like History�s Project Blue Book. When I look at it as entertainment with a bit of history thrown in, I find the show to be intriguing. However, when I look at it as a historical document, I see the many flaws in it� not in the story telling, but in the history that it is so loosely based on. I can, of course, point out the flaws in the Lubbock Lights tale from the beginning when we see a lone man in an airport control tower, to the end where we see Little Finger� I mean Hynek� along with Captain Michael Quinn, told the big secret that would solve the Lubbock Lights as some sort of top secret project. There are hints in the show of real history such as the discussion of the recently installed mercury vapor street lights in downtown Lubbock that were brighter and therefore might be, somehow, responsible for the sudden appearance of the UFOs. Carl Hart's photographs of the Lubbock Lights. And, although the electromagnetic effects displayed when the UFOs knock out the lights of Lubbock and later affect Hynek�s and Quinn�s car never happened, six years later in Levelland, Texas, such things did happen. Levelland is just a few minutes from the western side of Lubbock, so we have a combination of these two events that involved multiple witnesses. I do wonder if some of the criticism from my UFO colleagues might be a tad bit overblown. I mean, they seem to want precision and accuracy here but in other dramas based on history, sometimes get a pass, though they have their own trouble with the truth. I don�t remember such discussions about the lack of reality in the many versions of the Grassy Grass� that is the Little Big Horn. I can�t think of one of them, from They Died with Their Boots On to the ludicrous Custer of the West, that got the history right. (Well, maybe Son of the Morning Star, which I mention here so that I don�t get emails about it.) I do wonder if the historians were as annoyed with those movies as the UFO community is with this. (Which is not to say that my UFO colleagues would worry about such things in those movies, only that others, who have a deep interest in history might.) The point here is that Project Blue Book is not a documentary. It is a drama, based, very loosely, on the history of Project Blue Book. I mean we could point to the time line that jumped from the Gorman Dogfight of 1948 to the Flatwoods Monster of 1952 back to the Lubbock Lights of 1951. Quinn, I don�t think, is Captain Edward Ruppelt who was the chief of Blue Book from late 1951 to 1953. Quinn mentioned to Hynek in this episode, that he had flown escort missions in Europe during the war. That suggests Quinn was a fighter pilot. Ruppelt served in the Pacific Theater as a bombardier/radar operator, just to point out one difference between the two. Any criticism of Quinn and his actions in the series shouldn�t be seen as a slight to Ruppelt or a criticism of him. Taking this sort of trouble with timelines and invention, the appearance of Don Keyhoe in Episode Three sort of proves the point. Keyhoe mentions Roswell, but Keyhoe never talked about crash retrievals. He didn�t think much of alien abduction reports and it seemed he was happier arguing with the Air Force about secrecy. The scene in which he was threatened by the MIB with a pistol to his head was over the top. While they certainly could present Keyhoe�s �war� with the Air Force, this suggestion, to me, was a step or two too far. If I have been directing this episode, I would have not filmed that scene. So, we all sort of agree that some of these things could be handled better, but I do know that they�re making a TV series and not a documentary. The problem is that my Ufological colleagues seem to hate the show for not being a documentary and are unable to watch it was just a drama. They fear that it will harm the UFO field by the way it is presented, but I think that ship sailed a long time ago� headlines in newspapers in 1947 said that flying saucers had been seen in many states except Kansas. Kansas, at the time was dry. No drunks to see flying saucers. At the opposite end of the spectrum, a few have suggested that the series might inspire some to look deeper into the UFO phenomenon, to see beyond the superficial. Anything that generates an interest and leads to the truth can�t be all bad. No, I don�t really think this is going to hurt the UFO field. We do that ourselves� MJ-12 anyone? How about the alien autopsy? So, they got a few things right in this episode. They went off on tangents in some places. But the production values are astounding. They do a good job of recreating the world of the early 1950s� down to all the people smoking. As for the Lubbock case� they hint at some college professor who has seen the lights and had a picture of them that is reminiscent of the photographs taken by Carl Hart, Jr. in 1951. The professor, draws on the black board (as opposed to a white board) an illustration showing how the Plover, a small, west Texas bird, might have been responsible for the sightings. Except, the Plover do not fly in a V formation and rarely in groups larger than six or seven. Plover do not answer the question of what was seen over Lubbock. Although the Air Force did write the sightings off as birds, they didn�t really explain the photographs taken by Hart. I had the opportunity to talk to Hart about the Lubbock Lights and the photographs he took. Although I have already posted the following to the blog, given the renewed interest in it thanks to Project Blue Book, I reprint it here: On February 1, 1993, I had the opportunity to interview Carl Hart about the photographs. What follows is that interview. (For those interested in more about the Lubbock Lights, I suggest a look at my 1997 book, Conspiracy of Silence.) I offer the notes of the interview without commentary (well, not much). After learning that the man I was talking with had taken the famous pictures, I asked, \"Were you looking for the lights when you saw them?\" He said, \"Oh, no. Of course, this was summer time and very hot. We didn�t have anything like central air conditioning. I slept with the windows open and I liked to sleep with my head stuck out the window and there they were.\" Carl Hart, Jr. in 1951. \"You saw them fly over one time?\" \"Oh, I think if I remember there were like three formations... of course they had been in the news here for a week or two before I happened to see them and they usually showed up in several flights when they would so... when I saw them, I went on outside with my camera...\" \"Did you get a feel for the size of the objects or how high above you they were?\" \"Not really... the only thing I saw was lights. Wasn�t any other objects associated with them. Wasn�t any noise...\" \"Now you were questioned quite closely by the Air Force...\" \"The Air Force and everybody else.\" \"Did the Air Force give you a final conclusion of what they thought you had photographed?\"\n\"No, no they didn�t. I never did hear an official version. I heard some unofficial things that came out later... about how they thought I had faked them somehow or another.\" (Attempts to duplicate the pictures by a professional photographer failed... and because of that, this part of the mystery remains unsolved.) \"Of course, you hadn�t faked them...\" \"No.\" \"You have no idea what they were?\" \"I really don�t. I�m not even sure who it was. There was someone tried to duplicate the light in a laboratory by reflecting light off a pan of water where they could cause a ripple run down the water and they could cause them to move and his theory was that it was a cold air inversion and that it had waves in it like the ocean and the sensation of them moving across the sky so I don�t know if that�s what happened or not.\" (This was Dr. Donald Menzel whose results were published in 1952. Later Menzel decided, without evidence, that Hart had faked the pictures. Menzel, it seems, could not admit that some aspects of the UFO phenomenon were inexplicable.) \"You really have no clue about what you saw...\" \"I really don�t. Nothing�s ever come forward to explain those and there wasn�t anything for me to judge them by other than just the lights on the bottom of just one object or group of individual lights... They were lights either on something or individually.\" Did you know the professors who had seen the things the first night?\" \"Later on, I did. I didn�t know them at the time.\" \"Were they aware you had taken the pictures?\" \"Oh, yeah. I think there were some of the ones felt like I had stolen their glory... They weren�t too receptive of what I had done as best I could recall.\" \"Have you made any money off this thing?\" \"I might have made three or four hundred dollars total over the years.\" \"The pictures appear in books and magazines all the time.\" \"I wasn�t aware enough of what was going on to copyright them. If anyone paid my anything it was to save themselves from possible legal problems later on... for several years people would ask before they would use them... My advice from a friend and professional journalist at the time was that if you copyright them somebody�s going to think you faked them and are trying to make money out of them\" Hart did tell me that he doesn�t particularly disbelieve in flying saucers. He said, \"I�m kind of open minded on that. If one would show up some place else here, I think I�d accept.\" I asked him one last time if he knew what he had photographed. \"I really don�t.\" This covers just that one, small aspect of a much larger case. However, you can�t call the case solved if an important portion of it has not been explained. True, some of the sightings were of birds and others might be explained as natural phenomena, but the photographs have not been identified, there is no evidence that Hart faked them, and no reason to reject them. Oh, and for those interested in such things. Ed Ruppelt, in his 1956 book, mentioned that he knew the solution to the Lubbock Lights but that he couldn�t reveal it. No, not because it was some top secret project but because to do so would identify his source on the matter. He had promised the scientist who came up with the solution not to name him.

It was followed by \"Pressure,\" and he took the time to greet his audience.  \"Thank you very much,\" he said. \"Welcome to Madison Square Garden. Glad you made it. It was a really shitty day today. Thank you for coming,\" he added and went on to acknowledge that he has a \"very good job,\" and rightfully so, implying his monthly residency at The Garden. He took his fans on a trip down memory lane to 1971 and to his Cold Spring Harbor album with the mid-tempo and soothing \"Everybody Loves You Now.\" After polling the audience for the following song choice, the powerhouse piano-driven ballad \"Vienna\" bested \"Just the Way You Are.\" Joel treated the audience to the cynical \"The Entertainer\" from his 1974 album Streetlife Serenade. While that particular album may have not been his most popular studio offering by any means, his vivacious rendition of the song tonight more than made up for it. \"The Entertainer\" featured Tommy Byrnes on acoustic guitar and musical director David Rosenthal on neat synths. He picked up the pace with \"Sleeping With the Television On,\" and during the follow-up, \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song),\" archived monochromatic images of the city displayed on the giant televised screen. Andy Cichon, from Adelaide, Australia, commanded the bass. Veteran Billy Joel band member, saxophone player Mark Rivera, displayed his tremendous talent on the woodwind instrument on such tunes as \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" and \"New York State of Mind.\" After the anthemic \"Allentown,\" he delivered his own western theme song \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid,\" which was an added  Joel's piano-driven instrumental of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" preceded the liberating \"My Life,\" where the got the crowd on their feet. During the ballad, \"She's Always a Woman,\" his vocals were rumbling and comfortable. \"Only The Good Die Young\" was one giant singalong with the audience and longtime band member Crystal Taliefero[1] was exquisite on percussion on \"The River of Dreams.\" Joel immediately broke into a smooth rendition of \"Take It Easy\" by the Eagles, which was well-received. Another highlight in the concert was when Mike DelGuidice (rhythm guitar player and background singer) showcased his three-octave range, on key, on \"Nessun Dorma,\" with Joel accompanying him on piano. They both did the late Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini justice. Joel closed his 60th consecutive residency show with \"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant\" and \"Piano Man.\" For his encore, Joel rocked the electric guitar on \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" where he gave a history lesson to his fans. It was followed by \"Uptown Girl,\" featuring the resonant vocals of Mike DelGudice, and \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me.\" If that weren't enough, Joel rounded out his lengthy set with \"Big Shot,\" as well as \"You May Be Right.\" \"Billy Joel was pretty freaking awesome tonight,\" Henry Canosa said, longtime fan and attendee, about his 60th consecutive show at the \"World's Most Famous Arena.\" In other Billy Joel news[2], the iconic rocker announced that he will be kicking off baseball stadium shows in 2019, all of which are in conjunction to his Madison Square Garden monthly residency. The Verdict Overall, Billy Joel was exceptional tonight as part of his record-breaking 60th consecutive residency show at The Garden. All of the songs he played tonight certainly struck a chord with his audience, and they were with him every step of the way. They knew they were in the presence of musical greatness: the \"Piano Man's\" presence.  Joel's \"Take It Easy\" tribute to the Eagles was solid and noteworthy, and his entire band delivered as a whole; moreover, creative director Steve Cohen did an excellent job on the lighting design for the concert. Billy Joel's live set garnered five out of five stars. To learn more about acclaimed singer-songwriter Billy Joel[3], check out his official website[4].

Ci prepareremo e risponderemo alle esigenze, come � gi� successo per il reddito di inclusione ancora in vigore� : il sindaco Marco Cavicchioli attende il dettaglio delle disposizioni della nuova legge per mettere in moto gli uffici, che saranno coinvolti nell�applicazione della misura decisa dal Governo per sostenere le famiglie pi� povere.  \n Domande entro male  \nMarzo � il mese in cui sar� aperto il canale per presentare le domande. Nel frattempo non cessano i benefici per chi gi� riceve il cosiddetto Rei, il contributo alle famiglie in difficolt� economiche e con problemi di occupazione che dall�anno scorso garantisce un massimo di 539,82 euro mensili. La legge assegnava ai servizi sociali dei Comuni il compito di valutare le domande e la presenza dei requisiti e poi di attuare la seconda parte della norma, i progetti personalizzati che accompagnano ogni beneficiario verso la riqualificazione professionale e l�ingresso nel mondo del lavoro. \n La situazione a Biella  \nAl 30 settembre 2018 il Comune aveva ricevuto 469 domande, 285 delle quali sono state accolte. La mole di lavoro per il settore dei servizi sociali � stata notevole, sia per l�esame delle richieste sia per la redazione dei progetti di inclusione che dovevano coinvolgere caso per caso anche altri soggetti come Centro per l�impiego, scuola in presenza di figli minori o servizi sanitari. Le pratiche tra l�altro dovevano essere gestite e inviate nei termini imposti dall�Inps, pena il rischio di perdere il beneficio economico. �Ringrazio gli uffici per aver risposto in modo egregio a questa necessit�� sottolinea il sindaco. �E so che saranno pronti a fare lo stesso anche con le nuove misure� . \nChi valuter� le domande  \nLe domande per il reddito di cittadinanza, che garantir� un massimo di 780 euro, saranno valutate dall�Inps e non pi� dai servizi sociali dei Comuni. Ma gli uffici saranno certamente coinvolti nei progetti di inserimento nel mondo del lavoro. Non solo: la nuova norma prevede che i beneficiari, in attesa di un impiego, si mettano a disposizione dei Comuni di residenza per otto ore ogni settimana, durante le quali dovranno svolgere servizi di pubblica utilit�. �Questo � il punto pi� delicato� sottolinea il sindaco �perch� non tutti possono fare tutto: occorre formazione professionale, oltre alle attrezzature e alla copertura assicurativa.

Within the USA and China, tariffs have been the main cause of disturbance both in the soft and hard commodity markets. Combining this with the unsure future of UK and European trade deals, legal challenges in the next 12 months are promising to be an interesting period of unorthodox opportunities.With the input of tariffs on steel by the USA, the industry has once again been set back globally and the full effect of this is yet to come. And with the value of copper hitting a 5 year low, alongside the decrease in the value of gold due to a rise in the value of the dollar, the metal trading market is in a period of instability.In the soft commodities markets we have seen some interesting movements, with the USA's soya bean exports to the world's biggest market, all but disappearing despite the sanctions being removed. This has meant Brazil has seen growth in soya bean exports which has benefited them greatly, since the price of Arabic coffee beans dropped to a 12 year low. Technical advances in farming (growing bananas without soil) matched up with the stability in prices have provided opportunities that look to be strong in the coming year.The development of financial technology has caused new threats for companies; however the evolving industry is bringing up new opportunities for investment, providing a new dynamic market away from the traditional structure and process. This is likely to have a major effect of the market in 2019.In this latest edition of In-Short, we look at some of the issues that have arisen in relation to derivatives with the impending approach of BREXIT; how the US have reacted to the continuation of shipping petroleum from the Middle East; the changes to GAFTA regulations and the practical effect of this on the industry; and cyber security breaches that are affecting our clients.In this issue we cover:OFAC fires shot across the bow of Middle East shipping industryReview of recent Gafta contract amendmentsMore than market access: the regulatory impact of Brexit on EU and UK firmsCyber fraud - follow the moneyOFAC fires shot across the bow of Middle East shipping industryBy Patrick Murphy (Partner, Dubai)OFAC, together with the US Coast Guard and the US Department of State, has just issued a timely reminder of the risks of shipping petroleum products to Syria and Iran.At the same time that it added 9 persons and entities to the SDN list, whom OFAC suspect were involved in the shipment of petroleum products to Syria, OFAC has reminded the shipping, oil trading and financial institution communities generally that anyone (including non-US persons) who provides support to the Syrian regime by, for example, facilitating imports of oil to the Government of Syria could be designated as a SDN.The notice also warns persons generally who own, control or insure a vessel that transports crude oil from Iran to Syria, or countries that have not received a reduction exemption waiver, that they could be subject to secondary sanctions penalties for engaging in those activities.The notice itself does not impose any new sanctions on Iran or Syria; it is, rather, a reminder of the existing US primary and secondary sanctions in force against both Syria and Iran in relation to the sale and transportation of oil cargoes. However, there are two particularly notable elements to the notice. Firstly, it sets out a non-exhaustive list of 35 vessels that are suspected of having delivered oil to Syria between 2016 and 2018. The vessels themselves have not all been added to the SDN list, but the implication of naming the vessels is clearly that the United States has been monitoring carefully their activities and will be monitoring others in the future.Secondly, it sets out a list of known deceptive practices used to ship petroleum products to Syria, including falsifying cargo documentation such as bills of lading, carrying out STS transfers of cargo at sea, and the disabling of AIS systems to conceal locations. None of these measures are new in themselves; they have been employed for years by parties engaged in \"sanctions busting\". However, OFAC is saying that it knows this too and is actively on the lookout for parties engaging in such activities.\"OFAC has reminded the shipping, oil trading and financial institution communities generally that anyone (including non-US persons) who provides support to the Syrian regime by, for example, facilitating imports of oil to the Government of Syria could be designated as a SDN\"And it warns others to look out for them as well. In a list of risk mitigation measures, it encourages financial institutions, such as insurers, as well as ship registries, charterers and port operators to look out for AIS manipulation or documentary discrepancies that would be red flags for potential sanctioned cargoes.Coming just two weeks after the re-imposition of the second tranche of secondary sanctions against Iran, this notice is therefore a timely reminder that shipping and oil trading in the Middle East, with its unique concentration of sanctions risks, is firmly at the centre of US regulatory attention. For those engaged in the industry, the risk mitigation measures identified by OFAC are a sensible starting point for managing sanctions risk. For example, caution should be exercised in relation to suspicious requests in relation cargo documentation (such as issuing bills of lading with suspicious \"Eastern Mediterranean\" discharge ranges) or when dealing with vessels with suspicious periods of time with no AIS connectivity. With the political climate in the region showing no sign of changing, those risk mitigation measures might well be in force for some time yet.More than market access: the regulatory impact of Brexit on EU and UK firmsBy Owen Williams (Associate, London)A hard Brexit will not only affect UK firms and gives rise to more issues than just market access.Much attention has been given to the problems which UK firms will face in accessing EU markets in the event of a hard Brexit. However there are a number of less headline- grabbing changes which firms will also need to consider. These changes will not just impact UK firms and EU firms should not think of Brexit as simply a British problem. Indeed, a number of the changes brought about by a hard Brexit may have a bigger impact on EU firms than on UK firms.As with any article on Brexit, this one comes subject to the usual caveat that the actual position following the UK's withdrawal from the EU will depend on the terms of any agreement reached between the UK and EU. This article considers what the position would be in the event of a no deal Brexit, assuming no side arrangements are made between EU and UK regulatory bodies.For commodity traders, some of the most important changes relate to the impact a hard Brexit will have on their status and obligations under the main pieces of legislation governing derivative trading, namely the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). This article will focus on the ways in which these two pieces of EU legislation are to be \"on-shored\" in the UK following Brexit, the approach to central counterparties (CCPs), the calculation of the clearing threshold, and the availability of the intragroup exemption, under EMIR, and the calculation of the ancillary exemption under MiFID II.On-shoringReaders are likely to be familiar with the general process by which the UK will on-shore EU law following Brexit. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the Withdrawal Act), the UK will retain all UK legislation that implements EU Directives and incorporate EU Regulations into UK law.Unsurprisingly, this is not a straightforward task. It is not possible to simply cut and paste EU legislation into UK law. For example, references to EU agencies need to be replaced with their UK equivalents. For this reason, the Withdrawal Act allows the government to correct deficiencies in retained EU legislation that result from the UK's withdrawal from the EU. .The UK has published three statutory instruments (some of which are still in draft form) to onshore EMIR under the Withdrawal Act (UK EMIR) and a draft statutory instrument to onshore MiFID II (UK MiFID II). The process of correcting deficiencies in UK EMIR and UK MiFID II may result in some differences in firms' status and obligations after Brexit.EMIR - Clearing thresholdBoth EU and UK firms will have to consider whether their clearing status under EMIR will change following a hard Brexit.Currently firms whose speculative OTC derivative contracts (as opposed to speculative contracts traded on exchanges) are valued above a certain threshold, known as the \"clearing threshold\", must comply with stricter risk mitigation rules under EMIR.In the event of a hard Brexit, UK exchanges will no longer be recognised by the EU and contracts traded on UK exchanges will be classed as OTC. As a result EU firms will need to treat contracts traded on UK exchanges as OTC and include such contracts when calculating whether their speculative OTC trading exceeds the clearing threshold.Similarly, under UK EMIR, contracts traded on EU exchanges will be considered OTC and UK firms will need to include such contracts in calculating whether they exceed the clearing threshold under UK EMIR.Thus, a number of firms, both in the EU and UK may find that, following a hard Brexit, they no longer fall below the clearing threshold and may need to reclassify as NFC+.EMIR - Intragroup exemptionA hard Brexit could mean that companies are no longer able to rely on the intragroup exemption under EMIR.The intragroup exemption exempts trades between two EU members of a group, or between an EU company and a company in a third-country which benefits from an equivalence decision, from EMIR's clearing obligation.If Britain leaves the EU without a deal or any equivalence decision, intragroup trades between an EU company and its UK sister company will no longer benefit from the intragroup exemption. As a result, certain EU companies will be required to clear intragroup trades with UK companies.For UK companies, the position is different. Under UK EMIR, the government has proposed a temporary exemption regime, which will allow UK companies that relied on an intragroup exemption prior to exit day, to continue to rely on this exemption after Brexit. This appears to be one area in which Brexit will have a more direct impact on EU firms than on UK firms.EMIR - Central CounterpartiesOne of the main concerns of EU firms over the past few months has been the risk that EU will no longer recognise UK CCPs.Under EMIR, certain firms are required to clear their OTC derivatives with a CCP which is authorised or recognised by the EU. The vast majority of derivatives are currently cleared through UK CCPs. In the event of a hard Brexit, these UK CCPs will no longer be recognised by the EU for the purposes of EMIR. Thus clearing an OTC trade with a UK CCP will no longer be sufficient to meet the clearing obligation under EMIR.With an estimated 67 trillion worth of notional derivatives cleared by EU firms on UK CCPs, the EU has recognised that this is an issue which could potentially undermine market stability. On 19 December 2018 the European Commission adopted an Implementing Decision which will allow UK CCPs which were authorised prior to Brexit to continue providing clearing services after Brexit. The European Securities and Markets Authority has said that it is aiming to adopt recognition decisions in relation to UK CCPs well ahead of Brexit. It appears that this is one of the few issues where a hard Brexit should have a limited impact.MiFID II - Ancillary activities exemptionFollowing a hard Brexit, firms will need to consider their status under MiFID II. In particular, those commodity traders which currently rely on the ancillary activities exemption will need to ensure that they can still do so after a hard Brexit.The ancillary activities exemption allows firms that trade commodities derivatives on own account largely for the purposes of hedging to remain outside the regulatory scope of MiFID II. In order to rely on the exemption firms must pass two tests, one of which, the \"market share test\", compares the size of their speculative trading activity in the EU against the overall trading in the EU in each particular asset class.In the event of a hard Brexit, trading data from the UK will no longer be taken into account in determining the overall volume of trading undertaken in the EU. In addition, EU firms will no longer have to consider trading done on UK venues when considering the size of their own speculative positions. Given that almost all trading in certain asset classes, such as coal, oil and metal, takes place in the UK, the fact that UK data will no longer be included in the market share test could lead to problems for EU firms. It remains to be seen whether the EU will make any amendments to the market share test following Brexit. However, without UK trading data, the calculations will look quite different after Brexit.For UK firms, there is a little more certainty. Under UK MiFID II firms must continue to consider trading in the EU in determining their status under the \"market share test\". Thus most UK firms which currently pass the market share test are likely to continue to do so after a hard Brexit. Again this is another area where a hard Brexit may have a bigger impact on EU firms than UK firms.More than market accessA hard Brexit will impact commodities firms beyond the obvious market access issues. This article does not provide a complete list of factors which firms will need to consider. However firm's should note that a hard Brexit will require all firms, and not just those in the UK, to look closely at all aspects of their business. Unfortunately this is a task for which there are no short-cuts.Review of recent GAFTA contract amendmentsBy Eurof Lloyd-Lewis (Partner, UK) and Sophie Morrison (Trainee Solicitor, UK)This article was first published in Gaftaworld, December 2018 issueGAFTA have approved the amendment of a number of its standard form contracts, the most significant of which are the removal of the contractual limitation period, or \"time bar\", in respect of claims for \"amounts payable\" from GAFTA Arbitration Rules No. 125 (\"GAFTA 125\"), and the elimination of the express obligation, in GAFTA No 49, for FOB sellers to have cargo ready at any time during the agreed period of delivery.GAFTA 125 - Abolition of Rule 2.3Prior to 1 September 2018, Rule 2.3 provided that:\"In the event of non-payment of amounts payable, either party may notify the other that a dispute has arisen and, within 60 consecutive days from the date of that notice, appoint an arbitrator or apply to Gafta for an appointment of an arbitrator\".A degree of ambiguity surrounded which disputes fell within its remit. Prior to September 2016, the 60 day time bar was triggered by notice that a dispute had arisen as provided for in the \"Payment Clause\" of the contract. Removal of the reference to \"Payment Clause\", in the September 2016 iteration, arguably meant that it now applied to all claims for \"amounts payable\" arising out of the contract.GAFTA has now decided to remove this rule in its entirety from contracts which incorporate GAFTA 125 entered into on, or after, 1 September 2018.Save for disputes where arbitrators need to examine samples - the time limit here being counted in days, depending on whether Rye Terms or others are used - the limitation period (being one year) is determined by reference to the parity of the contract (FOB, CIF, etc.), thereby simplifying the time limits scheme.GAFTA has also removed from the Payment Clause in all of its contracts the term that:\"Amounts payable under this contract shall be settled without delay. If not so settled, either party may notify the other that a dispute has arisen and serve a notice stating his intention to refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules.\"Practical Effect of ChangeTraders who incorporate GAFTA 125 into their contracts would be well advised in the event of a dispute to commence GAFTA arbitration proceedings at the earliest opportunity. As a matter of English law, which governs all GAFTA contracts, the commencement of arbitration proceedings in accordance with GAFTA 125, interrupts the running of time, i.e. protects the time limit. This protective measure comes at little or no cost to the claimant, and does not carry an obligation for the parties to immediately progress the reference, so commercial negotiations can continue. Once proceedings have been commenced, the claimant has one year, from the date of commencement, to prepare and serve submissions, or to renew their claim to arbitrate for another year - see clause 4.10.GAFTA 49Previously, Clause 6 of GAFTA 49, provided:\"The Sellers should have the goods ready to be delivered to the Buyers at any time within the contract period of delivery\".This term was unique to GAFTA 49.At common law, under a \"classic\" FOB contract, where the contract does not state who has the option as to the time of shipment, the buyer is normally entitled to call for shipment at any time during the period. The seller is correspondingly obliged to put the goods on board any ship nominated by the buyer but this does not mean that the seller is bound to have the goods ready at the port of shipment for the whole of the period.GAFTA 49 provides for delivery at buyer's call, but contrary to the common law position the previous edition required the seller to have the goods ready to be delivered to the buyer at any time within the contractual delivery period. This could be onerous for the seller. Under the new clause, sellers have been relieved of this obligation, but the contract still provides for delivery at \"Buyers' Call\" so the seller has to have the goods ready within a reasonable time of receiving proper shipping instructions from the buyer.Practical Effect of ChangeThis amendment sees a return to the common law position and aligns the contract with the other GAFTA FOB contract forms. As a consequence, a buyer will only have grounds for rejection and termination if the seller fails to load the goods within the contractually agreed delivery period. If a buyer wants the right to terminate because the goods are not available for shipment at any time during the delivery period then an express term must be agreed. This is not however necessarily all good news for FOB sellers as there may be a greater potential for delay which may result in demurrage and detention claims by buyers. Sellers are also exposed to such claims because clause 6 obliges them to continue loading beyond the agreed delivery period, provided that the carrying vessel was presented within it.Cyber fraud - follow the moneyBy Andrew Rourke (Partner, UK)In 2018 we saw clients of all sizes, sectors and domicile affected by cyber-security breaches. Perhaps the most prevalent in the commodities and trading sector was the trend of email hacking and faking. A chain of correspondence between Party A and Party B arranging payment for the sale of goods, for example, is intercepted by hackers who then impersonate the parties using a very slightly altered email address so as not to arouse suspicion. Typically the hackers then advise Party A that the payment account details have been changed and Party A transfers sums to the wrong account.These altered account details are very often not suspicious in and of themselves. The fraudster's email account may be as subtle as a single letter change to the email domain name. It is not hard to see how even the most sophisticated business may fall victim to such fraud.Basic checks can help to prevent such fraud, including checking email addresses carefully particularly if there is a change in tone of correspondence or a change to payment details and checking any requested changes to account details via telephone (ideally with a known individual) with your counterparty. Having a strict policy of rigorous checks on account changes can go a long way to solving the problem. Even with the most extensive training procedures for staff, mistakes can still happen and there is no question that as monitoring techniques improve, fraudsters will find alternative ways of disrupting business for financial gain.In the event payment is made to a fraudulent account, the payer should notify their bank immediately of the suspected fraud. If notified early enough, the paying bank may be able to interrupt the payment or, if not, alert the receiving bank who should freeze the receiving account pending further investigation. Informing the police and, where relevant/ appropriate, the Action Fraud service in the UK or a local equivalent elsewhere is also important.Employees should also be made aware of the need for care in how they deal with such incidents as, for example, 'tipping off' is an offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and, as such, legal advice should be taken as soon as a suspected fraud takes place.If the payment cannot be interrupted, there are a number of legal steps available in the English courts which may assist in recovering any payment obtained fraudulently. The assistance available from the courts will depend on the specific facts of each case but include:A 'Norwich Pharmacal Order': Such order requires the receiving bank to disclose certain documents or information about the receiving bank account and the account holder, with a view to tracing the location of the funds. This type of Order is typically obtained where a party knows that wrongdoing has taken place against it but does not know the identity of the wrongdoer, yet can identify a third party who has this information.A Bankers Trust Order: This is often referred to as a sub-species of the Norwich Pharmacal Order and is available where (i) there is a fairly clear cut fraud and (ii) the claimant seeks disclosure of confidential documents, usually from a bank, to support a proprietary claim to trace assets. This type of relief is only available where, on the face of it, there is a clear case that the relevant funds held by, or passed through, the bank, belong to the claimant. It is also necessary to demonstrate a real prospect that the information might lead to the location or preservation of assets to which the claimant makes a proprietary claim.A Freezing Injunction: Such order restrains the bank from allowing transfer of the money in the account and/or fraudster from disposing of or dealing with its assets. The purpose of a freezing order is, typically, to preserve assets until judgment can be obtained or enforced. It is often possible to seek a freezing order in conjunction with the above two remedies.No matter what action is taken, acting quickly is key. The English courts stand willing to assist victims of corporate fraud with urgent applications to freeze monies or trace funds, but if a party is slow to act, the monies are likely to have disappeared, often overseas, with little chance of recovery. In such circumstances, the party who is left out of pocket will have no remedy or will be left to explore claims against its counterparty and/or the bank(s) involved.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Clyde ... LLPClyde ...

Contribution: 'Economic Policy Uncertainty and Recession Probability'","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Econbrowser: http://www.econbrowser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Today, we are fortunate to present a guest contribution written by Pawel Skrzypczynski[1], economist at the National Bank of Poland. The views expressed herein are those of the author and should not be attributed to the National Bank of Poland. Is it worth to use the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUI) as measured by Baker et al. (2016) together with the yield curve slope to track the business cycle turning points?One can check how the EPUI performs when added to a standard term spread model specification to answer the above stated question. Monthly news-based EPUI time series goes back to 1985, however it is possible to construct a much longer time series of the EPUI with the use of historical data published at http://www.policyuncertainty.com[2]. That is exactly what we perform here to obtain EPUI time series covering 1954-2018 period which allows us to estimate the augmented term spread model over the same sample as the standard term spread model. Namely we use monthly EPUI data covering Jan 1954 - Dec 2018 as shown in the figure below.The analysis focuses on four specifications of probit models for the NBER dated recessions binary variable on the righthand side of the estimation equation: spread_12 - model with 12-month lagged 10Y3M spread as the only regressor,spread_12_epui_6 - model with 12-month lagged 10Y3M spread and 6-month lagged EPUI as regressors,spread_6 - model with 6-month lagged 10Y3M spread as the only regressor,spread_6_epui_6 - model with 6-month lagged 10Y3M spread and 6-month lagged EPUI as regressors. Tables below report the obtained estimates of model parameters.  Table 1. The spread_12 modelTable 2. The spread_12_epui_6 modelTable 3. The spread_6 modelTable 4. The spread_6_epui_6 model Figures below present the obtained U.S. recession probabilities in-sample and their out-of-sample forecasts. Due to the structures of models used only the spread_12 model is able to forecast 12-months ahead, while remaining models forecast 6-months ahead. The predicted probabilities are reported in table 5. Table 5. Predicted U.S. recession probabilities The general picture that emerges is that adding the EPUI to a standard term spread model increases the volatility of probabilities, especially during this expansion, which is not surprising given that the EPUI itself became more volatile in recent years. To check whether adding EPUI to the standard model makes sense we focus on the ROC [3]curve analysis of the models. Table 6 reports false positive rates of the models for threshold probabilities from 10 to 90%. The indication here is not very appealing in favor of the augmented models as for 50% threshold models without EPUI are characterized by lower false positive rates.  Table 6. False positive rates Similarly, AUROC values, which can be interpreted as the goodness of fit measure of the models, indicate that the augmented models are very similar to the standard ones. Table 7 reports the obtained AUROCs. It is worth to outline that the null hypothesis of AUROC being equal to 0.5 is rejected at any reasonable significance level for each model, so we may conclude that all the models do better in predicting economic activity turning points than a toss of a coin does. Table 7. AUROCs Overall once again the standard 10Y3M term spread probit model occurs to be a very strong benchmark when it comes to tracking U.S. business cycle turning points. The presented analysis shows that gains of including the EPUI in a standard model are quite scarce. In turn the answer to the question stated at the beginning is that using the EPUI to track business cycle turning points doesn't seem to improve much the signals generated by the term spread itself. You can do it, but it doesn't seem that it will help you much. Back to the drawing board then Nevertheless, be aware that all models used here indicate that during 2019 the predicted odds of a recession in the U.S. are on the rise, which is associated both with the recently flattening yield curve and rising economic policy uncertainty.ReferencesScott R.

But for the past 120 years the opposite has been true. Raw death rates fall in bad times, including the Great Depression and the 2008-2009 recession.\nThis is somewhat of a puzzle, especially since we know that suicide rates go up in bad times.\nThe effect is not very large but a century of sociological study has confirmed that it is real in North America, Europe, and Japan. Why?\nSome possible factors:\nThere are many potential contributors. One of the more predictable perks of a poor economy is fewer job-related accidents. The most-experienced workers are the ones most likely to keep their jobs during a recession, and slower production can allow for more attention to safety.\nPeople also tend to drive less, which translates to fewer traffic accidents. And fewer vehicles on the road might also help to explain why air quality is better. �When employment pops up, so do things related to pollution � commerce, industry, trucks on the road,� says Mary Davis, an environmental-policy specialist at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. The air-quality connection might also help explain why studies have also linked recessions to reduced cardiovascular and respiratory problems, as well as infant mortality. (I doubt air quality is as much of an issue now, but remember that before 1970 more economic activity meant burning more coal in plants without scrubbers, meaning pollution might get a lot worse.)\nResearchers have suggested other explanations. In addition to dirty air, cardiovascular issues are known to be exacerbated by stress, a poor diet, lack of exercise, drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco. Working less and having less money to spend could translate into more sleep, exercise and home-cooked meals, as well as less job-related stress and less money for pints of beer and cigarettes. There is some evidence that this logic plays out. Based on data from 1987 through to 2000, Ruhm found that smoking and excess weight declined during economic downturns, whereas leisure-time physical activity increased. When Iceland�s economy crashed in 2008, and the price of imported goods such as tobacco and alcohol rose, citizens consumed fewer of those products. And US data from 1977 to 2008 showed that a husband�s unemployment reduced how much alcohol his wife drank, on average, irrespective of her own employment status. Even people who fear job loss, but remain fully employed, Catalano�s research suggests, might still cut back on alcohol to seem a more indispensable employee. The impact of work on our physical and mental health is decidedly mixed. Long-term unemployment causes depression, but when people are really busy (as they are more likely to be in economic booms) they are stressed and more likely to grab bad meals on the run.\nSo we can do nothing and slide into depression and die that way, or work ourselves to death. . . .","tags":["economics","medicine","society"],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:15:58Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:49Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:15:58Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722016&p=4s5&v=1&x=X2jMOnrXr4a4rf1r08Q06g","commentsUrl":"http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8304928500646903522&postID=5967150419882847964","outboundUrls":["https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00210-0"],"wordCount":"475","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350722016","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"DEATH & DYING","score":"79"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"ECONOMIC DECLINE","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"MENTAL HEALTH","score":"72"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"INFANT MORTALITY","score":"74"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"VEHICLE TRAFFIC","score":"73"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"IMPORT PRICES","score":"50"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"SUICIDE","score":"72"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS","score":"89"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"ECONOMIC NEWS;

expert claims it was impossible for the company to impose unfair terms on Apple","content":"Jan 25, 2019( BGR: Your Mobile Life: http://www.bgr.in Delivered by Newstex)  Silicon chip-making giant Qualcomm is currently involved in a legal battle with Apple[1] and an anti-trust case with US Federal Trade Commission. The company is currently focusing at the court proceedings in the anti-trust case. As part of the proceedings, legal experts from both sides are making arguments to present their side before the court. Part of the anti-trust case by FTC[2] also dependents on the battle between Apple and Qualcomm. During a recent round of arguments, while replying to the question if the company operates as a monopoly in the market, the chip-maker added that it was impossible for the company to operate as the same. According to a report by 9to5Mac, Qualcomm stated that it did not operate as a monopoly in the market as it 'simply didn't have enough power'. The line of questions were connected to the case where Apple claims that Qualcomm imposed two unfair terms on the smartphone maker. The report also pointed out the two unfair terms that Apple[3] is referring to in its criticism of the chip giant. The first unfair term is where Qualcomm is asking Apple for a patent license fee even after Apple is purchasing the SoCs directly from them. Apple has termed this practice as 'double dipping'.Watch: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Features First Look The second unfair term that the company is referring to 'a percentage of the total cost of the phone' instead of a flat fee on the SoC chips. As part of this, the company claims that Qualcomm[4] will benefit from all the improvements that Apple will make in the future iPhone[5] models. Qualcomm expert claimed that Apple was open to reject or accept the terms. https://www.bgr.in/news/apple-admits-qualcomm-was-sole-supplier-for-4g-modem-because-no-other-vendor-matched-specifications/ Also Read Apple admits Qualcomm was sole supplier for 4G modem because no other vendor matched specifications[6] According to the report, Qualcomm claimed that instead of putting unfair terms, the company 'actually offered discounts' to retain Apple as it feared competition from Intel[7]. This case has revealed a number of details regarding the negotiations between the two companies. As previously reported, Apple[8] had no choice but to accept chips from Qualcomm[9] as chips from other players were not up to the mark. Apple also wanted to use Qualcomm modems in its 2019 iPhone lineup but failed to lock the deal.

Recent additions to Google Chrome, the WebUSB and WebBluetooth APIs, allow sites to interact with devices connected to the device the browser is run on. While there are certainly cases where this may be useful, it is sometimes the case that the introduction of new features has unforeseen consequences. In the case of WebUSB and WebBluetooth, it is opening the doors for sophisticated phishing attacks that could bypass hardware-based two-factor authentication devices such as some Yubikey devices. Security researchers demonstrated recently[1] that the WebUSB functionality of the Google Chrome web browser can be used to interact with two-factor authentication devices directly and not Google Chrome's API (U2F) designed for that purpose. The attack bypasses any protection that two-factor authentication devices offer that are susceptible. Devices need to support protocols for connecting to a browser other than through U2F for the attack to work and users need to interact with the phishing site for the attack to be carried out successfully.Chrome displays a prompt when a site tries to use WebUSB or WebBluetooth. The user needs to allow the request, and type or paste the account's username and password in designated forms on the site. While that puts a barrier in place, one that requires user interaction before it can be carried out, it still does highlight that new features may open up new possibilities for abuse. Users need to pay attention to permission dialogs that the browser displays to them. Attack sites could be designed in a way to provide users with reassurance that such permission prompts are necessary for functionality. While it is unclear how many users would fall for that, especially those using hardware two-factor authentication devices, it is almost certain that some would. The two open source browser extensions Disable WebUSB[2] and Disable WebBluetooth[3] address the issue directly; they block the APIs in the browser so that they may not be abused. It should be clear that these extensions will block any interaction with these APIs; it does not distinguish between good and bad requests. If you never use WebUSB or WebBluetooth, you may want to consider installing the extensions for that extra bit of security. The extensions run silently in the background and block any attempt to use the WebUSB or WebBluetooth API. Now You: Do you disable certain browser features? Ghacks needs you.

Who do you see pulling off the big win, and who is leaving Phoenix's Chase Field full of disappointment? (Hopefully, it's not me�who will be there in person�or the fans paying their hard earned money!) The Royal Rumble match itself is full of potential, as WWE superstars on the men's and women's sides vie for a shot at the championship of their choosing and a guaranteed high profile match at the granddaddy of 'em all�WrestleMania 35! Emanating from 'New York City,' (really New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, also home to two New York NFL teams), the state is set for a historic WrestleMania that could very well see the women take center stage and close out the night (more on that in a minute). I'll give you my overall picks in a moment, but the most intriguing match, for me, is Brock Lesnar defending his WWE Universal Championship against Finn Balor. The decision to move Balor into the match made me a happy man, as that's the match I want to see. It's not important for an IWC fan to be happy with the card, but I'll take this one! No one expects Finn Balor. No one, that is, except for me! Before we move forward, I must remind you that I was the one who picked Austin Aries to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Bobby Roode at Destination X in 2012. This is important because I�Greg DeMarco�was the only one to make this selection. The proof is in the pudding, folks![1] But GregBalor winning? Really??? I'll start with this: Finn Balor has a better chance of beating Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble than Braun Strowman did. Per SportsBettingDime[2], a bet on Braun Strowman would come at +275. But the same bet on Finn Balor gives you slightly worse odds at +225. When the match changed, the challenger ended up with better odds of winning. But there's more to it for me, as Finn Balor has a weapon that we can't forget: The Demon. Now, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that Brock Lesnar could beat The Demon. And it's also possible we don't see The Demon at the Royal Rumble. But it that were the case, what good is The Demon. You can tell the story of Finn wanting to win the match on his own accord, but The Demon IS Finn. It's still him, just him finding that dark corner of his soul, necessary for overcoming certain obstacles. (And Baron Corbin, but that's another story!) HOWEVER, Finn Balor has said that he won't be The Demon at the Royal Rumble, as reported by ESPN[3]. But I think that supports my argument even more. Look at the story they are telling. No one believes in Finn Balor. Vince McMahon himself continually dismisses the chance of Finn Balor winning. Now, I must recognize that this could be Daniel Bryan at WrestleMania 30 all over again. The company leadership doesn't believe in the popular, albeit smallish babyface, and he becomes the WrestleMania hero. Balor could win at Elimination Chamber, or he could enter the Rumble as The Demon and win. So I must recognize that Finn Balor could realistically lose at Royal Rumble, but still leave WrestleMania as the Universal Champion. According to those odds above, no singles champions are slated to lose at the Royal Rumble. I can't see that happening. Finn winning here opens up a world of possibilities for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania, and opens things up for Brock Lesnar as well. It's a win-win for WrestleMania as a whole, and should be given more consideration than we're giving it. Spoiler Alert: I am picking Finn Balor to win the Universal Championship at the WWE Royal Rumble. I also have no problem being wrong. A few other items for you: � Charlotte Flair is winning the women's Royal Rumble, and she has the best odds to do so. That's because LOL CHARLOTTE WINS is a real thing, people. WWE is building a legend in Charlotte. And before you think WWE doesn't build legends, let me remind you that it's all a work. � The men's Royal Rumble is wide open if Finn wins. If Brock wins, I still say AJ Styles pulls it off and slays The Beast at 'Mania. If Finn wins, I expect Drew McIntyre of have a career making night and win the Rumble match. Obviously Seth Rollins cannot be ignored. � Shane and Miz win the Smackdown Tag Team Championships, because WWE. � Asuka beats Becky Lynch thanks to interference from Nia Jax, and Becky returns the favor by interfering and eliminating Nia from the Rumble match, setting up their WrestleMania showdown. � Ronda Rousey isn't losing to Sasha Banks[4], that potential WrestleMania show closing showdown with Charlotte is too good for Vince to pass up. � CM Punk[5] won't show up in the Royal Rumble. I know, it hasn't been reported, but you know you were thinking it! I look forward to your all-positive comments! If you're going to Takeover, I'll see you there! And if you're at the Royal Rumble, come see myself and Worked Over co-hostess Miranda in section 130, wearing a Chairshot t-shirt[6]!

Con un lungo fiume  che non ha nulla da invidiare  ai pi� bei parchi naturalistici che abbia mai visto. Cercare un Oswiecim  fuori rotta, non convenzionale, � praticamente impossibile perch� qui sembra funzionare veramente tutto in armonia e con una qualit� di vita importante.  Eppure, la sera, abbandonate le autostrade  polacche e imboccate le vie di campagna che precedono il luogo, ho la sensazione che ogni rotonda termini nel nulla. Un buio sordo che attutisce e nasconde ogni cosa. Camminare  all�alba lungo il parco che costeggia  il fiume Sola � una esperienza  imperdibile. La natura appare incontaminata  e fertile, abitata da una fauna selvatica per nulla intimorita dalla vicinanza dell�uomo. Ho avuto la fortuna di giornate cristalline, che rendono i colori brillanti, le forme evidenti.  Eppure qualcosa non torna, come una dissonanza insistente. I fiori e le piante non convincono fino in fondo di questo perfetto ritratto da Eden. Sembrano impregnate di una  omert� fatale e definitiva.  A ben pensarci ogni cosa ti avverte. Non lo sai ma hai gi� introiettato l�indefinibile.  Una risonanza lontana della mostruosit� senza limiti che impregna l�aria per l�eternit�. Prima ancora di entrare ad Auschwitz, nome  tedesco che il delirio nazista aveva  recuperato dalla precedente denominazione  austro-ungarica del paese, ho cominciato una curiosa lotta  con le parole. Quel posto � come una compressione dell�universo. Dove  il sussulto della scarnificazione del corpo e dell�anima di milioni di persone  ha generato come un buco nero. \n\nLe mie parole, i miei pensieri hanno  cominciato a distorcersi, a dichiararsi  inutili, come inutile appare  ogni cosa in quel luogo a un certo punto. Suoni, colori, voci, vengono attraversati da una frequenza non udibile  che torce ogni tuo ragionamento  come un argano colossale.  Intollerabile. Inaccettabile. Abnorme.  Non basta. Non significa nulla. Ogni termine si dissolve nel momento  in cui lo pronunci. Ecco. La sola aria di Oswiecim, che trasuda Auschwitz anche a distanza, sgretola  ogni prodotto del tuo cervello, ogni  rifinitura linguistica, ogni sofismo  e ogni riflessione. Forse l�unica dimensione possibile � la tragica contemplazione di una voragine che ha inghiottito l�umanit�. Non c�� nulla  dopo Auschwitz. Eppure, mi dico, la vita scorre tranquilla. Regolare. Con flussi enormi di turismo e indotti che un luogo come Oswiecim non avrebbe  mai potuto immaginare.  Forse fa anche parte della prosecuzione  della vita. Ma come artista mi sento sdoganato dalle ragionevolezze  e dico che intorno a un luogo come Auschwitz dovrebbe esserci un diametro di almeno 50 km di deserto. \n\nPer andare a Auschwitz dovresti  attraversare il deserto. Dovresti  farti deserto. Dovresti avere un tempo e uno spazio di spoliazione dalla vita che ti � concessa e che qui � stata negata.  Un rabbino sopravvissuto, in una delle interviste proiettate in continuo  in uno dei padiglioni nazionali dei blocchi all�interno del campo 1, parla del dialogo avuto all�ombra del fervente lavoro dei crematori e il gelo  polacco. Un dialogo surreale con un altro martire sul Salmo 27. La questione  � perch� nel versetto 14 sia scritto �Spera nel Signore due volte e non una�. Con una semplicit� tipica delle intuizioni geniali e pragmatiche  la risposta � che dopo la prima volta avrai certamente uno scoramento  derivato dall�apocalisse dello  spirito e della carne, e quindi � necessaria  la seconda volta per ricordartelo.  Personalmente credo che anche un milione di volte sarebbe nulla a fronte del ripetersi dell�orrore  che deve essere sembrato inesauribile.  Di fronte alla indefinibile, incomprensibile indifferenza degli aguzzini.  Non sono predisposto alle effusioni. Eppure quella sterminata umanit� trasformata in carne da macello, che comunque � ancora l� e ti parla continuamente  mentre attraversi i bellissimi  viali di betulle che incorniciano  i mostri, mi ha dato la necessit�  di abbracciarla, di una carezza, urgente quanto inutile. Ho potuto accarezzare  un corpo vivo e pulsante. Ma erano gli elenchi sterminati dei morti. Una bibbia delle bibbie dell�apocalisse  senza fondo. \n\nLa presenza di quello che � successo per sempre trasfigura anche quegli elenchi, e se ci appoggi il viso, senti il corpo di tutti i corpi, con il suo peso  di piet� chiesta e negata, con le sue lacrime inascoltate, con lo scempio  delle vite, dell�anima e del corpo. Le questioni storiche, le questioni filosofiche,  le questioni sociali, arretrano  sullo sfondo come un accessorio  inutile, pure inevitabile. In primo piano rimane una sorta di vuoto mentale, un compianto assente,  una assenza di fiato che non torna. La piet� � ancora l� a reclamarsi.  Non c�� riscatto. Solo un debito inestinguibile. Auschwitz, a dispetto dei nazisti che lo hanno progettato per distruggere, � un corpo pulsante, presente, vibrante.  Un corpo discreto e violento che ti invade per non lasciarti pi�.  Al blocco 11, detto il blocco della morte, se la empatia ha fatto minimamente  breccia, la discesa � allucinante.  Anche a te che scendi per guardare senza pericolo in una luminosa  mattina di ottobre, sembra di scendere verso il patibolo. Un patibolo  non immediato. � un patibolo  distillato in tappe progressive di disumanizzazione in cui ogni riferimento  possibile ti viene strappato dall�anima e dal corpo. Le celle di meno  di un metro quadro con un ingresso  dal basso, completamente buie sono la visualizzazione della sepoltura  da vivi. E continua il mio vuoto  mentale, il vuoto dello spirito. Qui anche gli interruttori della luce sono terrificanti. Ogni singolo mattone � complice. Nel corridoio a fianco incontri  il calvario di padre Kolbe. Il suo gesto � simbolo della resistenza estrema  all�annientamento, che io voglio  credere, abbia avuto tanti altri, meno conosciuti protagonisti. Anche questo momento di riscatto dell�uomo  non ha un sapore dolce. Ha una durezza indescrivibile, che solo una fede o una testa dura e capace di sostenere  il buio assoluto della speranza pu� sopportare. Il primo giorno di visita mi lascia il desiderio di tornare, come a trovare dei cari. La nuova alba sul lungo fiume  mi conferma le sensazioni del giorno prima. Tutto torna. \n\nA Oswiecim  ti trovi in un luogo cos� speciale che ogni cosa vive della sua tremenda  consapevolezza. Non evidente, ma estremamente presente. Subito dopo, la nuova visita. Prima che i gruppi, non sempre attenti, invadano  il campo. Provo una strana intimit�,  ora che non ci sono suoni e distrazioni.  E rivedo tutto come se fosse  ancora nuovo, ancora il tentativo di un dialogo impossibile, di una vicinanza  che forse � solo nella mia testa.  O forse no. Vorrei stare un mese a Oswiecim e tornare qui ogni singolo  giorno e sono certo che nulla sarebbe  mai uguale. Auschwitz � sfuggito  ai suoi stessi creatori. Dove la umanit�  doveva essere annientata, la umanit�, a un prezzo atroce, ha impregnato  le pietre, le piante, i sassi, le valvole infami delle recinzioni, ogni singolo edificio, ogni singolo gancio. A 1.600 km di distanza Auschwitz continua a essere presente. Eppure � come se la tentazione del quotidiano  faccia di tutto per rendertelo estraneo,  come una fuga dal reale, come  una parentesi da relegare alle idee.  Questo � lo stesso presupposto del crimine dell�indifferenza che ha visto complice il mondo. La negazione  dell�umanit� che fa differenti gli uomini dai complici. Se le trappole  della mente sono molteplici per ingannare e generare anestesia, vi � un solo antidoto. L�incontro vivo. E non ricordo di aver incontrato nulla di cos� dolorosamente vivo, cos� commovente, cos� fisico come i muri  del campo e le piante di Oswiecim.","tags":[],"harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:49Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:49Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722042&p=4s5&v=1&x=Xcvnc1AHA6XKvyGVQpYHpg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"1219","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350722042","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.avvenire.it/c/2019/PublishingImages/afddedcc663140a7b2977e17a7d39323/pianteauschwitz.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Religion + Spirituality","score":"92"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Death + Dying","score":"92"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Globalization","score":"77"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Deserts","score":"73"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Jews + Judaism","score":"60"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"name":"Raul Gabriel, Oswiecim","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"4437","name":"Avvenire","homeUrl":"http://www.avvenire.it","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Italy","countryCode":"IT","region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"6.00","pageAuthority":"60.00","domainAuthority":"69.00","externalLinks":"1089202","links":"1191447"}},"feed":{"id":"169677629","name":"Avvenire","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"91"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940754474","id":"38350722043","language":"Catalan","languageCode":"ca","title":"��s molt important que fam�lia i escola es donin la m��","content":"l'entitat \n\nQuin �s el vostre objectiu? \n1.

He is very concerned with manner in which the Democrats fought this last election. They created Political Action Committees (PAC) upon PACs, designed to obscure the source of the money, most of which was from out of State. They began their corporate campaign began a year before the election when the recruited candidates they believed would be universally popular. The influx of cash enabled Democratic State Senate candidates to outspend their Republican opponents 3 to 1. In addition the money spent by the candidates, the PACs spent enormous amounts on mailers in support of Democrats, and in opposition to Republicans. Secretary Gardner also had an opinion the job of the Chairman of a Political Party. He likened them to a college President. Their number one job is to raise money using the prestige of their position. All of this points to the need for a Chairman who can: one raise money; and two organize local Republican Committees. For my money the man for this is Stephen Stepanek. In working with me on the Republican Fund from 2006 though 2009, and then with Speaker Bill O'Brien, he has learned how to raise campaign funds, including from outside the State. Most importantly, he has the personal resources to make being the Chairman his full time activity. During his time as Chairman of The Hillsborough County Republican Committee he tripled the number of local Committees. Stephen Stepanek was in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for 12 years. During those years he rose to several leadership positions as Chairman and Vice Chairman of Committees and Minority Whip when the Democrats were in the majority. As a former New Hampshire legislator he understands the importance of electing Republicans to the New Hampshire House of Representatives and Senate. The last time we've had a NHGOP Chairman with practical political experience from running campaigns to working in government was Gov. John Sununu. That brought us the super majorities of 2011/2012. So, who is Keith Hanson? He has lived in New Hampshire for 3 yr. But he didn't register to vote as a until November 2018, same day registration at the polls. On Saturday, he'll have been a New Hampshire Republican for 74 days. Have you noticed he drives a car with Florida license plates? There are three options for this: It isn't his car. The car is owned by a Florida corporation. In which case, one might wonder about his commitment to New Hampshire? He is breaking the law which requires registrations and licenses to be changed to New Hampshire within 60 days of moving here. And if he has lived here for 3 years., where did he vote in 2016. Or did he even vote? The post What Makes a Good NHGOP Chairman[1] appeared first on Granite Grok[2].

The campaign targets U.S. Reps. Brian Mast of Florida's 18th Congressional District and Ross Spano of Florida's 15th. The ad highlights fact that the members of the Coast Guard[3], border patrol[4] and the Transportation Security Administration[5] (TSA) continue to have their pay withheld as the shutdown continues. Those employees fall under the Department of Homeland Security[6], which remains unfunded. 'The Coast Guard, Border Patrol ...A just missed another paycheck, thanks to Rep. Spano,' reads one of the ads. The digital campaign will run on Facebook and will be geo-targeted to constituents in competitive districts nationwide, according to the DCCC. The shutdown showdown has already hurt Republicans in the polls[7], with surveys showing the GOP bearing the brunt of the public's blame.Now, the DCCC is hoping it hurts their re-election bids as well. http://www.leelowry.org/'When you work hard to keep our country safe, you should receive your paycheck, period,'said DCCC Spokesperson Cole Leiter. 'But now, workers who risk their lives everyday are about to miss another paycheck as Republicans in Washington continue to play games with the lives of hardworking Americans, and their families' livelihoods and financial security,' he said. 'Republicans' recklessness threatens our national security, and it's critical that voters know exactly who is putting Americans' lives at risk in pursuit of a wasteful and deeply unpopular partisan agenda.' Mast for his part, has pushed separate legislation[8] to ensure the Coast Guard is paid during the shutdown. But Democrats have rebutted similar standalone bills[9], instead attempting to force Republicans to re-open the government in full or not at all. The Coast Guard's head officer has called the lack of payments 'unacceptable[10].'https://www.fpl.com/innovationTSA leaders have also spoken out[11] about the strain its agency is under, with many employees utilizing sick days[12] while they await their next paycheck. And the Donald Trump administration is facing a lawsuit from border patrol agents[13] over being forced to work without pay. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also rescinded an invite for President Trump to give the State of the Union address inside the House chamber, per tradition. Pelosi originally cited security concerns, though DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said her agency would be prepared for the event[14]. However, Trump has since backed down[15], admitting the Jan. 29 date would need to be pushed back without consent from House leadership. Mast held on to his seat in 2018, defeating Democrat Lauren Baer by 8 percentage points. Spano won his race by 6 percentage points but has faced accusations of violating campaign finance law by using personal loans during the campaign[16]. Some even called[17] for congressional leaders to refuse to seat Spano[18], though those ultimately fell on deaf ears. Both could face competitive contests in 2020. A sample of one of the digital ads, targeting Spano, is below.

president: 'It's the right time for me to visit Ethiopia'","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier leaves for Ethiopia on Sunday. He takes with him his government's backing for Abiy Ahmed's reform program. In an interview with DW, Steinmeier talks about his plans for his visit.During his four-day trip, President Steinmeier will hold bilateral meetings with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and President Sahle-Work Zewde, as well as meet with civil society representatives, to gather first-hand information about the country's ongoing reform process. On Wednesday, Steinmeier will meet with Moussa Faki Mahamat, the Chairperson of the African Union, which is headquartered in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Abeba.DW: This is your third trip to Africa as German president - you have previously visited Ghana, the Gambia, South Africa and Botswana. How do you see Ethiopia? Similar to the Gambia, which is also experiencing a surprising democratic change?President Steinmeier: It is different because it won't be my first visit to Ethiopia [having visited the country in 2014 as Germany's foreign minister]. I am somewhat familiar with the country although, of course, it was another time and under different political conditions. In the past short year, Ethiopia's people have witnessed breathtaking transformation - changes and reform efforts introduced by the new leadership that have led to a new dynamic of change. That's why I very quickly said 'yes' to the invitation by President Sahle-Work Zewde and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. It's crucial not only to honor from afar the courage of these changes in favor of democracy - but as a European and German to also be there on the ground to encourage the journey along this path. That's why it's the right time for me to visit Ethiopia. As German president, you are returning to a 'new Ethiopia'. Currently, however, there are serious concerns about numerous ethnic conflicts flaring up. Multi-ethnic Ethiopia is now facing a serious stress test. Will you raise concerns about this with President Sahle-Work Zewde and Prime Minister Abiy? We are coming with great curiosity but we are not naive. Because we recognize what challenges the prime minister and the president have faced: making peace with neighboring Eritrea, their arch enemy, opening borders that have been closed for decades, decriminalizing being in opposition, releasing political prisoners, planning legislative reform to change laws used to harass the civilian population, and, an equally courageous step, cutting the numbers of positions in the cabinet and populating it equally with men and women. These are quite revolutionary decisions for Africa. And of course these changes aren't the end of the process. It requires perseverance to create successful change in such a large country that is still marked by old rivalries and where divisions have yet to be reconciled. It requires people to be patient - it needs time before the process bears fruit for everyone. I hope the population is patient and I hope the political leadership maintains its perseverance.Prime Minister Abiy is the symbol of Ethiopia's democratic change. Many Ethiopians express concern that such huge expectations are concentrated in a single person. Instead, they call for the strengthening of institutions and - given Ethiopia is a federal state - the regions. With Germany also having a federal constitution, what experiences can Germany, as a long-term partner, bring Ethiopia?In Europe and in Germany, we understand the differences between reform efforts and harvesting the fruits of the reforms. That's why we shouldn't restrict ourselves to observing from a distance. If we believe [Abiy's] way is the right way, then we should support him. If Germany, as an economically strong country in Europe, wants to provide support, then this can be achieved through political cooperation, through consultations such as institution building. But of course the country also needs economic stimuli. This is why I'm traveling with a business delegation, with companies I know have a real interest in Ethiopia. And I hope this also helps Prime Minister Abiy in the course he is taking.Speaking of German commitment, last week the German parliament , the Bundestag, appealed to the German government to increase its involvement in the peace process between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many voices - among them Africans - believe Germany could play a substantially larger role in Africa. Why can't we rise to meet these expectations? Why do we often fall short in meeting African expectations?I don't think that we are falling short of expectations. The path Ethiopia is now taking deserves support. It is up to the Ethiopian leadership to assess whether we can also provide, for example, regional support in terms of lasting peace in the Horn of Africa and the relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea. And the leadership needs to signal what kind of support it would like to have for one or the other of these processes. I can't imagine there will be a lack of readiness on the German side.During your visit, you will also hold talks with the African Union (AU). Germany has been supporting the AU's Peace and Security Council for many years. Nevertheless, critics say member states act in solidarity with each other when it comes to human rights and electoral fraud - something seen most recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The organization also faces criticism for the pace of reform and its fiscal discipline. Are these topics all on your list for when you talk to AU Chairman Moussa Faki?The same applies to the African Union as it does to the European Union - the institution is only as strong as the members make it. For this reason, in the past I have understood the criticism of the African Union but I also said that the African Union can't move things in the right direction in African nations if its members haven't given it the appropriate authority. Nevertheless, there have been developments in the AU that I value and acknowledge and I hope there will be no setbacks - especially in foreign and security policy. In peacekeeping matters, the AU has become much more effective than it was 10 or 20 years ago.In recent years, there has been much discussion of Africa being a continent of possibilities. Last year, Germany hosted the G20 Africa Conference and there are various Africa initiatives such as the Compact with Africa. But at the same time, issues such as electoral fraud in Congo, civil war in South Sudan and migration dominate the public's perception of Africa. When will we really see Africa on equal terms, as is often avowed?That isn't something you can order. You can only try to do your part to make the European understanding of Africa more enlightened. This includes clarifying the concept of 'Africa'. There is not one Africa, there are various Africas. In addition, Europe should be more present and should - with an emphasis on meeting as equals - look for cooperation opportunities in which the other party feels recognized as a valued partner. In some areas, we are successful in this but unfortunately not in others. And I hope that the desire and determination grows in many African countries to look confidently and less accusingly at the moves by European states to come closer. Having a relationship on equal terms - to communicate with each other - is a two-way process but one to which Europeans need to make a greater contribution.This interview was conducted in German by

banks have fast and regular communication","content":"Jan 25, 2019( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: http://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  A further aspect of the digital banks I am talking with is that they have reviews all the time. Not formal reviews, but fast meetings with the business people, designers, developers and even audit and compliance all around the table. It is quick, frequent and informal unlike the old industrial organisation which has long, annual and formal meetings. That is the spirit of being agile. It reminded me of a company I visited in the 1990s and all of their meetings took place standing up. When I asked why, they told me that when people are sitting, they talk longer. So stand-up meetings were it. In fact, if you want to get a sense of what meetings used to be like, there is a well out-of-date but very funny, and very true to life back in the last century, video of John Cleese on meetings. [embedded content] The meeting would have a formal agenda and formal chair, an assistant to document the meeting and all parties invited to have their say during the meeting. I remember going to a meeting in the 1990s about a tradeshow that was coming up and we took two hours discussing the bag that would be given away. Should it be black or brown; real or faux leather; what logo and writing to put on it; etc, etc. Yawn. God, it was boring. To me, it's like today's conference calls. [embedded content] Anyways, the fast-moving digital banks focus upon quick and regular communication. It's similar to the movement away from email to chatroom. Emails used to be a way of CYA. You copy anyone and everyone who you think needs to see it, in order to make sure you've Covered Your Ass. And the email trail would pick up like a snowball, getting longer and longer and bigger and bigger and harder and harder to digest. No wonder emails are unnatural and, again, I met a firm back in the 1990s that would only allow an email to have a title. No content. Just a title. That was their way of fast communicating. Today, in this world of Slack, Twitter, WeChat and Whatsapp, we talk non-stop. We chat. We don't send limitless garbage that needs to be printed out to work out what the hell is being discussed. We just talk non-stop. These two 21st century ways of communicating are making a fantastic difference to life on office. Equally, the final one is the hot desk policy. Work from home or work in the office. Work wherever you want. Just keep in touch. My hot desks are in hotel rooms. But I met one bank that was moving from analogue to digital, and they really struggled with this. What? I won't have a desk? Where will I sit? They got over it and made an analogy to when you were being at home. Home is the building, it is not a room. The bank is the place and the culture, not a desk. So yes, now they hot desk and it works well. But they do more than that. They regular brainstorm and whiteboard. They have spontaneous meetings and idea generation. They don't have to gather all the people and get all the agenda locked down. So, a critical factor in today's modern company is that everyone has an open door for communication, digitally and physically. There are no formalities, except for sign-off of critical moments, but the build-up to any formal sign-off is formed from hundreds of reviews and thousands of chats. What a great way to work and it's not specific to digital banking. It's specific to digital transformation. The office of 2020 is very different to the office of 2000 or 1980. It's fast and agile. Is that how your office works?","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:49Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721938&p=4s5&v=1&x=iRVTQbuhYQAzSgjcyaf_ug","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"589","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved","duplicateGroupId":"38346837444","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{"itemId":"5V8K-6F81-F03R-N1K7-00000-00"},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"}],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"TALKS & MEETINGS","score":"90"},{"domains":["IND","SUB"],"name":"FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"HOME BASED EMPLOYMENT","score":"77"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"CONFERENCE CALLS","score":"72"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"TRADE SHOWS","score":"65"},{"domains":["IND","SUB"],"name":"CHAT ROOMS","score":"63"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"HOTELS & MOTELS","score":"60"}],"companies":[{"name":"One Bank Ltd","symbol":"ONEBANKLTD","exchange":"DHA","isin":"BD0126OBL006","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Open Door Inc","symbol":"3926","exchange":"TKS","isin":"JP3173560008","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true},{"name":"Open Door Inc","symbol":"OPNDF","exchange":"PINX","isin":"JP3173560008","titleCount":0,"contentCount":1,"primary":true}],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Chris Skinner"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Chris Skinner"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.996"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"John Cleese"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"John Cleese"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.999"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Organization"},{"name":"value","value":"Newstex"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Newstex"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"Twitter"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Twitter"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"}]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.10852253","entities":[{"type":"Person","value":"Chris Skinner","mentions":"2","score":"0.6","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"John Cleese","mentions":"1","score":"0.585372","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Anyways","mentions":"1","score":"0.25","evidence":"5","confident":true},{"type":"Company","value":"Slack","mentions":"1","score":"-0.6","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Company","value":"Twitter","mentions":"1","score":"-0.6","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Company","value":"WeChat","mentions":"1","score":"-0.6","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Company","value":"Whatsapp","mentions":"5","score":"-1.3","evidence":"5","confident":true},{"type":"Location","value":"open door","mentions":"1","score":"-0.075383","evidence":"4","confident":true}]},"print":{"supplement":"","publicationEdition":"The Finanser by Chris Skinner"},"author":{"name":"Chris M Skinner","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"LexisNexis Licensed"}],"source":{"id":"185631","name":"The Finanser by Chris Skinner","aggregatorId":"9","aggregatorName":"Newstex Publications","location":{},"metrics":{},"feed":{"id":"603773985","name":"The Finanser by Chris Skinner","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"LexisNexis Licensed","idFromPublisher":"3003","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"false","autoTopics":[]}}},{"sequenceId":"915940755249","id":"38350721940","language":"Italian","languageCode":"it","title":"Facebook ha ignorato per anni il problema degli acquisti in-app fatti dai bambini","content":"Facebook era al corrente del problema dei bambini (e in generale minorenni) che spendevano grandi quantit� di denaro negli acquisti in-app dei videogiochi all'insaputa dei genitori, ma ha fatto finta di niente per anni onde evitare cali di fatturato . � quanto emerge da una serie di documenti interni resi pubblici grazie a una class action intentata nel 2016. Le cose pi� gravi che compaiono nei memo interni sono le seguenti: \n  Facebook incoraggiava gli sviluppatori di videogiochi a permettere ai bambini di spendere soldi all'insaputa dei genitori per massimizzare il fatturato: una pratica che veniva addirittura chiamata Friendly Fraud .  In alcuni casi i bambini non si rendevano conto che stavano spendendo soldi reali , n� che la carta di credito dei genitori fosse collegata al gioco. Altri documenti evidenziano addirittura che nemmeno i genitori sapevano che Facebook aveva salvato i dati delle loro carte di credito. Alcuni dipendenti Facebook lo sapevano e avevano avvisato la dirigenza, che per� ha fatto orecchie da mercante per anni.  Un gruppo di dipendenti aveva sviluppato un metodo software che mitigava questo fenomeno, ma non fu implementato; agli sviluppatori fu detto che l'obiettivo primario era massimizzare i ricavi .  Quando i genitori si accorgevano degli addebiti - che sono arrivati fino a 6.500 dollari a settimana - e chiedevano un rimborso, Facebook faceva il possibile per negarlo , costringendo gli utenti a interpellare direttamente le banche o le autorit� (procedure naturalmente pi� complicate e onerose, e che quindi potevano scoraggiare alcuni). Quando decideva di rimborsare, cercava di farlo regalando oggetti digitali come equipaggiamenti e vite.   I tassi di chargeback (ovvero quando l'azienda che emette la carta di credito storna o annulla un pagamento su richiesta del cliente) sono talmente alti che rientrano pienamente nei parametri che per la FTC definiscono un business ingannevole . Tra l'altro, Facebook aveva implementato un software che attivava automaticamente una contestazione per ogni chargeback, senza nemmeno esaminare il caso.   \n� interessante osservare che una parte dei documenti sono il frutto di un'indagine interna che era stata avviata su segnalazione di Rovio, la societ� sviluppatrice di Angry Birds. Rovio si era accorta di un'impennata delle richieste di rimborso. Alcuni dipendenti avevano suggerito di imporre almeno l'inserimento del numero di carta se l'utente faceva acquisti in-app complessivi superiori a 75 dollari in poco tempo, ma non se ne fece mai niente. \n \nLa class action da cui provengono questi documenti era stata intentata da un gruppo di genitori colpiti da questo problema, e rigaurdava un periodo compreso tra il 2008 e il 2014. Dalla documentazione emerge che Facebook aveva raccolto oltre 35 milioni di dollari da account di minorenni nei soli Stati Uniti. La causa si concluse con un patteggiamento e, pi� importante, con un cambio di marcia da parte di Facebook , che implement� molti pi� controlli per limitare le spese in-app - e semplific� la procedura per le richieste di rimborso.

l'assegnazione della banda a 3,6GHz per l'utilizzo civile della rete di prossima generazione. \n \nLa decisione � stata presa nell'ambito delle attivit� volte ad uniformare lo spettro radio che verr� destinato al 5G all'interno della Comunit� Europea. La palla passa quindi ai Paesi Membri, che avranno tempo sino al 31 dicembre 2020 per adeguarsi alla decisione e - eventualmente - liberare la banda a 3,6GHz qualora fosse impiegata per altri scopi. Al momento non � stato stabilito alcun obbligo che limiti l'utilizzo di queste frequenze al solo 5G, lasciando quindi libert� agli operatori di disporne anche in altri modi. \n \nI 3,6GHz espandono ulteriormente lo spettro di frequenze disponibili tra quelle al di sotto dei 6GHz e si vanno ad affiancare ai 26GHz e ai 700MHz gi� individuati in precedenza. L'unificazione delle bande all'interno della Comunit� Europea ha lo scopo di rafforzare la posizione del vecchio continente e di facilitare la diffusione di uno standard condiviso tra tutti i Paesi.

However, the mark shown below, comprising a green circle alone, for the same goods and services did not fare as well. The Board upheld the refusal to register that mark on the ground that Starbucks failed to prove the acquired distinctiveness that it claimed. In re Starbucks Corporation[1], Serial Nos. 85792872 (left) and 86689423 (right) (January 17, 2019) [not precedential] (Opinion by Judge Michael B. Adlin).Green Circle on White Cup: The Board rejected the Examining Attorney's contention that the drawing (above right) was not an exact representation of the mark in use, as required by Rule 2.51(a). As to the class 30 goods, the cup in the drawing has \"the same shape as and appears identical to the cup in the specimen.\" (see specimen below). The \"fluid paintbrush strokes\" do not change the essence of the mark, nor does the differing shades of green on the specimen.As to the specimen of use for the Class 43 services (below), the minor additional details in the specimen do not create a different commercial impression from the mark shown in the drawing. Nor does the fact that the specimen shows the cup in perspective change the commercial impression.And so the Board reversed the refusal to register the white-cup-with-green-circle mark. [Starbucks' Section 2(f) claim based on five years of continuous and substantially exclusive use was not challenged].Green Circle Alone: Starbucks also sought registration of this mark under Section 2(f) (thereby conceding that the mark is not inherently distinctive), but this time the USPTO challenged that claim. The Board found that although Strabucks' sales and advertising evidence was staggering, the extent to which that evidence related to the green circle design rather than Starbucks' \"siren design\" (shown below) was unclear. Likewise, media references did not clearly refer to the green circle mark at issue. The Board found that the green circle does not create a \"separate and distinct commercial impression\" from the siren design. In fact, the background to the siren is not even mostly green and is not a circle. The green circle mark is not a \"minor\" alteration of the siren design that Starbucks uses. Thus the data regarding the siren design was not relevant anyway.Starbucks submitted the results of a survey purporting to show that the green circle mark had acquired distinctiveness, but the Board found that, although the survey had some probative value, \"it also has problems, and raises a number of questions.\" Dr. Kaplan used an inappropriate control, selected an underinclusive universe and designed a survey and questions (and provided a data set) that do not reliably establish an association between the mark in question and Applicant. Dr. Kaplan' choice for a control was the cup shown below, which he referred to as \"generic.\" The Board found his control to be a major concern: \"It would have been more logical, and reliable, for the 'control' cell to be shown a cup more analogous to Applicant's mark. For example, the control cup would have been more effective if it was beige (or even white) and featured, for example, a blue triangle placed centrally on the front exterior side.\"Moreover, many of the survey responses were ambiguous as to why the respondent named Starbucks when shown the applied-for mark on a cup. In addition, the dataset provided by Dr. Kaplan was not clearly segregated between different test groups. And, the Board concluded, Dr. Kaplan chose a universe that was too narrow: first, since the survey was conducted via the Internet, it did not include the 15% of consumers who do not use the Internet; and second, he also excluded participants who access the Internet by phone.The Board noted that the result might have been different if the survey and other evidence \"were more specifically targeted to assessing the mark in the '872 Application.\" Instead it found that Starbucks failed to prove that the green circle mark has acquired distinctiveness, and so the refusal to register that mark was affirmed.TTABlog comment: The criticism of the Kaplan survey because it was conducted via the Internet must be somewhat disturbing to survey professionals. Is the Board suggesting that we should go back to mall intercept surveys? Nationwide? How expensive would that be?BTW- See Rule 2.52(b)(1) concerning how to claim a particular shade of color.

In 2015, the lessee of one of the flats, Mrs Winfield, requested the landlord's consent to proposed works to her flat which included the removal of a load-bearing wall. The landlord was willing to grant its consent to the works, however, another lessee, Dr Duval, said that the terms of the lease prohibited the landlord from doing so.Mrs Winfield had covenanted at clause 2.6 of her lease \"not without the previous written consent of the Landlord to erect any structure pipe partition wire or post upon the Demised Premises nor make or suffer to be made any alteration or improvement in or addition to the Demised Premises.\" As this is a qualified covenant, it is subject to an implied statutory proviso that consent will not be unreasonably withheld.Mrs Winfield also covenanted at clause 2.7 \"not to commit or permit or suffer any waste spoil or destruction in or upon the Demised Premises nor cut maim or injure or suffer to be cut maimed or injured any roof wall or ceiling within or enclosing the Demised Premises or any sewers drains pipes radiators ventilators wires and cables therein ...\" This is an absolute covenant and so the lease does not provide for the landlord to grant its consent to an act which would otherwise amount to a breach of this clause.The landlord, meanwhile, had given a covenant in the following terms:Clause 3.19 - \"That every lease of a residential unit in the Building hereafter granted by the Landlord at a premium shall contain ... covenants of a similar nature to those contained in Clauses 2 and 3 of this Lease AND at the request of the Tenant and subject to payment by the Tenant of (and provision beforehand of security for) the costs of the Landlord on a complete indemnity basis to enforce any covenants entered into with the Landlord by a tenant of any residential unit in the Building of a similar nature to those contained in clause 2 of this Lease.\"Dr Duval sought to rely upon this clause which essentially has two elements: 1) a promise that each lease would contain similar legally binding obligations on each lessee; and 2) a promise to enforce the covenants at the tenant's request and expense. The second 'promise' is a contingent obligation, the relevant contingency being the tenant's request and the provision of security.Dr Duval pointed to the fact that clause 2.7 of Mrs Winfield's lease contains an absolute prohibition against cutting a wall and the landlord has covenanted at clause 3.19 to enforce that covenant if another lessee so requests. If the landlord has the right to grant consent to works which would otherwise be a breach of clause 2.7, or to waive compliance with that clause, it would have relinquished its power to comply with clause 3.19 and it was implicit in a covenant like clause 3.19 that the landlord would not do so.On the other hand, the landlord argued that it is entitled to do as it pleases with its property and to consent to what might otherwise be a breach of a tenant's covenant, thereby nullifying the effect of clause 3.19.The decisionThe Court of Appeal agreed with Dr Duval. Lewison LJ pointed to a long line of authorities in which the courts have held that where a party undertakes a contingent or conditional obligation, he is under an obligation not to prevent the contingency from occurring, or from putting it out of his power to comply with the obligation if and when the contingency arises.The court held that if the landlord waives a breach of covenant by a lessee or grants a licence to do something which would otherwise be a breach of the lease, it will be in breach of clause 3.19. This is the case not only where the lessee has already made the request for the landlord to enforce and has provided security, but also where the obligation under clause 3.19 remains contingent.Lewison LJ did, however, note that this does not mean that the landlord cannot grant a licence in these circumstances. The landlord has the power to license something which would otherwise be a breach of covenant - and that licence will be effective to preclude the landlord from subsequently taking enforcement action against the lessee - but the landlord will be in breach of clause 3.19 if it chooses to do so. The other lessees will have a cause of action against the landlord should they wish to enforce clause 3.19.Lewison LJ also noted that the position would of course be different if the clause in question is a qualified covenant - in other words, that the tenant shall not do the prohibited acts without the landlord's consent. The landlord would not commit a breach of clause 3.19 by granting consent.CommentThis case illustrates the need for landlords to be aware of their obligations to enforce tenant covenants at the request of other lessees.If a landlord has granted a licence consenting to an act which would otherwise be prohibited under a lease and the licence has been acted upon, the landlord will be unable to enforce the relevant covenant and so a disgruntled lessee could bring a claim against the landlord for damages for breach of its covenant to enforce.If, on the other hand, a licence has not yet been granted or, if it has been granted it has not been acted upon, Lewison LJ commented that it is possible that the court might grant an injunction either preventing the grant or requiring the licence to be undone in those circumstances.That being said, the decision is likely to have limited repercussions. If a lessee adopts a \"dog in the manger\" attitude (which criticism was levelled at Dr Duval by the landlord's legal team) and seeks to compel a landlord to enforce another lessee's covenants in circumstances where the relevant breach has little, if any, effect on the complaining lessee, the court is likely to take this into consideration and will no doubt award nominal damages as opposed to an injunction.If, however, a landlord proposes to authorise a breach which would have an adverse impact on other lessees, lessees will take reassurance from this decision that the landlord does not have 'carte blanche' to vary or modify covenants or to authorise something which would otherwise be a breach of them.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - Janaury 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Die Sprecherin des Landesgerichts, Christina Salzborn, best�tigte am Freitag der APA vorliegende Informationen. Der 59-j�hrige Ukrainer war Mitte Dezember in Amsterdam festgenommen worden, am 28. Dezember wurde er nach Wien �berstellt. \n \n  \n Schon 2005 wegen Gem�lde-Diebstahls in Ukraine verurteilt  \nDer Mann weist bereits eine einschl�gige Vorstrafe auf und ist somit nachweislich ein auf Kunst-Diebst�hle spezialisierter Profi. In seiner Heimat wurde er 2005 abgeurteilt, nachdem er ein Gem�lde des russischen Malers Iwan Konstantinowitsch Aiwasowski aus einem ukrainischen Museum entwendet hatte. \n \n  \n \nDen Ermittlungen des Wiener Landeskriminalamts zufolge soll der 59-J�hrige den Coup im Dorotheum im Rahmen einer kriminellen Vereinigung federf�hrend organisiert haben. Seine beiden Mitt�ter und das 1895 entstandene, 27 x 40 Zentimeter gro�e Landschaftsgem�lde \"Bretonische K�stenlandschaft\", das auf einen Wert zwischen 120.000 und 160.000 Euro gesch�tzt wird, sind weiter verschwunden. Der m�gliche Abnehmer des Werks k�nnte sich in Nordeuropa befinden. Der 59-J�hrige hatte f�r sich und die beiden Komplizen Flugtickets nach Schweden gebucht. \n \n  \n In Amsterdam mit internationalem Haftbefehl festgenommen  \nAuf die Spur des Mannes war man gekommen, weil er sich unter seinem richtigen Namen in einem Wiener Hotel eingecheckt hatte. Die Polizei glich den Namen mit Flugdaten ab und fand so heraus, dass der 59-J�hrige unmittelbar nach der Tat zun�chst nach Amsterdam geflogen war. Dort wurde er mit internationalem Haftbefehl festgenommen. Dass er identifiziert werden konnte, war gestochen scharfen Bildern aus �berwachungskameras im Dorotheum zu verdanken, die die drei T�ter beim Betreten des Geb�udes aufgezeichnet hatten.

Circuit Weighs In On Website Accessibility Obligations","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Executive Summary: Lawsuits claiming business websites are not fully accessible to blind and visually impaired individuals continue to proliferate. Businesses often respond their websites are not required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Internet accessibility cases have begun making their way to the federal circuit courts, and the Ninth Circuit recently weighed in on the issue, holding that a pizza delivery company was required to ensure its website and mobile app are accessible as required by the ADA.In Robles v. Domino's Pizza, LLC, a blind customer sued under the ADA and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. Robles contended that on two occasions he unsuccessfully attempted to order a pizza from a nearby Domino's via the company's website and mobile app. Robles claimed both platforms failed to comply with his screen-reading software, which vocalizes visual information on websites.The Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court that the ADA applies to Domino's website and app. The Ninth Circuit held the ADA mandates places of public accommodation, like Domino's, provide auxiliary aids and services to make visual materials available to individuals with visual disabilities. The nexus between Domino's website and app and a customer's ability to obtain food orders from its physical locations was deemed \"critical\": \"[t]he alleged inaccessibility of Domino's website and app impedes access to the goods and services of its physical pizza franchisesmdash;which are places of public accommodation.\"The Ninth Circuit, however, reversed the district court's decision dismissing the lawsuit. Despite holding the ADA applied to the website and app, the district court dismissed the lawsuit, holding imposing liability would violate Domino's right to due process. Specifically, the district court held that requiring Domino's to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (private industry standards for website accessibility that have not been adopted by the Department of Justice (DOJ)) without any significant guidance on what the DOJ would require of businesses to comply with the ADA violated Domino's due process rights. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, and reversed and remanded on this issue. It held Domino's has received fair notice that its website and app must provide effective communication and facilitate \"full and equal enjoyment\" of Domino's goods and services to customers who are disabled. The lack of specific DOJ regulations on specific internet accessibility parameters does not eliminate Domino's statutory obligations under the ADA. The district court could order compliance with WCAG 2.0 as an equitable remedy if it determines Domino's website and app do not comply with the ADA.Lastly, the Ninth Circuit held the district court could not rely on the \"primary jurisdiction doctrine\" to avoid ruling on the case. The doctrine provides that a court may stay or dismiss an action pending resolution of an issue better resolved and addressed by an administrative agency. Domino's asserted the DOJ should first issue its guidelines on website accessibility before the lawsuit could proceed. The Ninth Circuit held whether Domino's website and app were compliant with the ADA constituted a fact-based inquiry within the district court's competency.Employers' Bottom Line: The Ninth Circuit's ruling will further bolster plaintiffs seeking to assert ADA internet website accessibility claims against businesses. Importantly, the Ninth Circuit reiterated what many courts have also held, that the ADA applies to businesses using their websites as an extension of their physical locations mdash; here, a website and app enabling customers to order pizzas from nearby restaurants. Furthermore, the DOJ's failure, or reluctance, to issue further clarification on internet accessibility does not, at least in view of the Ninth Circuit, bar courts from potentially enforcing the ADA against businesses for failing to accommodate individuals with visual disabilities.Businesses should review the accessibility of their websites under the WCAG guidelines and the Section 508 standards (governing those covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act), to ensure their websites are accessible. Businesses should also post an accessibility statement on the website that informs the public of the company's commitment to accessibility and how to contact the company with any accessibility-related issues or concerns.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Mit seinem \nbeherzten Eingreifen verhinderte der Mann wahrscheinlich einen Unfall mit \nschlimmen Folgen f�r die Businsassen. Der Linienbus war am Donnerstagabend \npl�tzlich in Schlangenlinien gefahren, auf die Gegenfahrbahn geraten und hatte \nSteinmauern touchiert, teilte die Polizei am Freitag mit.

They are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices and warehouses, by valuation officers assigning a rateable value to these premises.Where a hereditament is wholly or partly occupied, rates are payable by the party who is in rateable occupation. However, the concept of rateable occupation is not straightforward where there are two or more parties exercising control over the premises in question.In this case, the Court of Appeal was ruling on an appeal brought by ATM operator Cardtronics and retailers Tesco, Sainsbury's and the Co-op (the Retailers) against a finding of the Upper Tribunal Lands Chamber. The ATMs in the retail premises were both internal and external, and were operated by banks in the same corporate group as the operators of the stores. The other ATMs were operated by Cardtronics in shops and other premises.The Tribunal held that the sites of the ATMs should be treated as separate hereditaments in rateable occupation by the bank or other ATM provider, not the owner of the host premises. This meant that the ATM site would be charged separate business rates, however, the Retailers found that in most cases, there was no corresponding reduction in the rateable value of the premises in which the ATMs were located, resulting in an increase in the tax burden of the Retailers.The Court of Appeal's decisionGiving judgment, Lord Justice Lindblom allowed the appeal that the ATM sites did not constitute a separate hereditament, and therefore the Retailers were still in rateable occupation of it.LJ Lindblom noted that the \"landlord-control principle\", as described in Westminster City Council v Southern Railway Co Ltd [1936] A.C. 511, should be used to determine who was in paramount occupation for the purpose of rateable occupation. This principle was that an owner of premises who retains sufficient control of the part of the premises owned by another party (as well as by himself) should be treated as being in rateable occupation of that part.In applying this principle, the Retailers were held to have retained sufficient control of the site of the ATMs to be regarded as being in rateable occupation of it and to prevent a separate hereditament being formed. The court relied on several findings of fact which indicated that the Retailers retained sufficient control over the ATMs:Access to the ATMs for regular servicing, maintenance and loading could only be achieved from within the store, and with the retailer's co-operation or consent;The ATMs enhanced the store's \"retail offer\" by adding to the range of services available at the store;The retailer's employees were often involved in servicing and maintaining the ATMs; andSome of the stores had been designed or adapted to accommodate an ATM.CommentThis landmark ruling means that the UK government and local authorities will have to refund retailers hundreds of millions of pounds charged in England and Wales since the government decided it would treat ATMs as separate premises.It is a helpful and common sense decision which will be welcomed by the thousands of retail businesses which currently have ATMs on their premises.The decision is also good news for ATM users, as there was a fear that ATMs would be removed if the Retailers lost their appeal.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - January 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Pompeo proclama la \"muerte del globalismo\" en el sepelio de Davos","content":"�\n                    AP Photo / Markus Schreiber \nEn el Foro Econ�mico Mundial de Davos (Suiza), que este a�o parec�a un sepelio, el Secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo, exmandam�s de la CIA, alab� los \"desarrollos positivos para el mundo\": desde EEUU hasta Brasil, pasando por Italia, con el regreso de un nacionalismo en el que tambi�n los \"pa�ses cuentan\". \n\nDavos, donde sol�a brillar como nadie el megaespeculador George Soros, se reh�sa todav�a a realizar sus exequias higi�nicas, mientras que el sepulturero estadounidense Pompeo les recomend� su entierro expedito. \n \nEra esperado que Pompeo citara al nuevo presidente de Brasil, Jair 'Messias' Bolsonaro: conspicuo representante del \" evangelismo sionista \" y hermano simbi�tico del trumpismo , con o sin Trump. \nLlam� la atenci�n que invocara a Italia, en el mero coraz�n europeo, donde Mateo Salvini, vice primer ministro italiano y ministro del Interior, emprende una cruzada nacionalista antimigratoria �al un�sono del premier h�ngaro Viktor Orban (enemigo ac�rrimo del h�ngaro-israel�-brit�nico-estadounidense George Soros) y la feroz opositora francesa Marine Le Pen de Agrupaci�n Nacional (ex Frente Nacional)� que busca atraer al ex premier de Polonia y presidente del partido Ley y Justicia, el cat�lico Jaroslaw Kaczynski, para conformar un eje \"soberanista/nacionalista\", seg�n el portal Breitbart, muy cercano a Trump. \nBolsonaro fue de las pocas figuras relevantes que asistieron a Davos, donde exclam� que \"la izquierda no prevalecer�\", mientras se doblegaba ante la �lite plutocr�tica para fomentar la privatizaci�n de Brasil a gran escala. \nPompeo defendi� el mantra de Trump \"Hagamos a EEUU Grande de Nuevo\" (MAGA, por sus siglas en ingl�s): se pronunci� a favor de la \"seguridad econ�mica\" y rechaz� la influencia de los organismos internacionales que no toman en cuenta los intereses del pueblo, por lo que \"en todo el mundo, los votantes se han desconectado de los pol�ticos y las alianzas pol�ticas que no representan sus intereses\" en \"Ohio, R�o de Janeiro y Roma\", donde se cuestionan los beneficios de la \"globalizaci�n econ�mica\". \nPompeo aduce que las \"fronteras fuertes son clave para hacer pa�ses fuertes\" cuando la \"seguridad econ�mica es seguridad nacional\" ya que, sin una econom�a robusta, los pa�ses pueden ser presa de las superpotencias con deuda extrema, desigualdad de la riqueza y p�rdida de la libertad. \n \nAdem�s:  Bolsonaro en Davos: \"No queremos una Am�rica bolivariana\" \nEl encargado de la pol�tica exterior de EEUU �una de las principales superpotencias junto con Rusia y China, coincidentemente pa�ses que reclaman tambi�n el nacionalismo con sus propias peculiaridades�, se manifest� por \"impuestos bajos, regulaciones simplificadas y reforma comercial\". Guste o disguste: los mandatarios de las 3 superpotencias globales (Putin, Xi y Trump) son \"soberanistas\". \nM�s que nada, Pompeo profiri� sin tapujos \"la muerte del globalismo\" en el sepelio de Davos de 2019, que est� m�s muerto que nunca , como se not� por la ausencia de los grandes l�deres del planeta y por la asistencia de personajes muy menores, con algunas excepciones. \n \nTambi�n:  Pedro S�nchez afirma en Davos que el mundo es cada vez m�s hostil para los no poderosos \nLos portavoces del globalismo en Gran Breta�a, The Economist y Financial Times, controlados por los banqueros Rothschild y George Soros, se retuercen del dolor cuando el control economicista de las \"elites (sic) occidentales\" se desfonda: en el mismo Londres, con el despliegue ca�tico del \"nacionalismo econ�mico\" del Brexit que fractur� al pa�s ; en Par�s, con la fronda rural de los indomables 'chalecos amarillos' que han puesto al borde de la guillotina al presidente Macron, anterior empleado de la banca Rothschild; en Washington, donde el trumpismo , con o sin Trump, otra manifestaci�n de la revuelta rural contra los globalistas urbanos y de las costas, despliega una mezcla ins�lita de 'nacionalismo econ�mico', evangelismo sionista y supremacismo racista blanco de los WASP (blancos protestantes anglosajones); y en Berl�n, donde la �ltima mohicana del globalismo, la desangelada canciller Angela Merkel ha sido puesta en jaque por el nacionalismo antinmigrante con el ascenso de AfD. \nNo es un asunto menor que las cuatro principales capitales del mundo occidental �Washington, Londres, Par�s, Berl�n� sufran los embates rurales en contra del globalismo que disloc� a sus sociedades para beneficiar a su insaciable plutocracia. \n \nEl exparlamentario brit�nico George Galloway, quien sufri� un choque de conciencia debido a la cat�strofe humanitaria de la invasi�n a Irak por el entonces primer ministro Tony Blair, expone el \"eje de la crisis mundial (\" Ca�da de los Imperios: Londres, Washington y Par�s al Borde del Colapso \") y los socavados pilares del globalismo, que reduce solo a 3 capitales, dejando de lado a Berl�n. \nGalloway enuncia que \"el viejo orden est� muriendo; y el nuevo todav�a no ha nacido\". Este axioma es muy relativo ya que justamente la \"muerte del globalismo\", no se diga de su principal foro en Davos, es inversamente proporcional al ascenso del nacionalismo, en sus diferentes variantes, que es denostado por los multimedia globalistas, que a�n conservan el control mundial de su '�nica verdad', y confunden en forma deliberada con el 'populismo', que a su vez, tiene diferentes acepciones desde EEUU, pasando por Europa hasta Rusia, no se diga en Latinoam�rica. Las guerras tambi�n son semi�ticas. \nNo te lo pierdas:  Presagios oscuros, �por qu� la crisis global podr�a estallar este mismo a�o? \n \nMartin Wolf, turiferario consuetudinario del 'globalismo elitista ', quien menosprecia al populismo, que confunde con el nacionalismo y lo cataloga de 'autoritarismo', afirma que las \"elites (sic) deben considerar su responsabilidad (sic) ante el resurgimiento mundial de hombres fuertes\". \nWolf hace una \" ensalada Macedonia \", donde mezcla a varios mandatarios del mundo que no profesan el globalismo y que lo combaten mediante su ant�doto: el nacionalismo, que no necesariamente es populista ( whatever that means ) ni 'autoritario' ni una 'seudodemocracia' cuando proviene de la voluntad popular mayoritaria. \nEn forma atroz, el presidente galo Macron distorsiona la sem�ntica universal cuando fustiga igual al nacionalismo de \"traici�n\": el \"patriotismo es el opuesto exacto del nacionalismo, ya que el nacionalismo es traici�n (sic)\". \nLa canciller �ngela Merkel, en v�as de ser despedida por el electorado alem�n, no se resigna a la \"muerte del globalismo\" y defendi� a contracorriente en Davos al multilateralismo de las instituciones globales, tipo FMI, Banco Mundial, OMC. Sentenci� en forma fatalista que otra cosa, que no sea el multilateralismo, \"solo acabar� en miseria\" cuando �en una cr�tica velada a Trump, quien desde�� la reuni�n de Davos�, defini� la fase presente como \"la fragmentaci�n del mundo multilateral\". \nEs evidente que el globalismo financierista benefici� a Alemania, pero Merkel no consigue asimilar que la fase geopol�tica actual constituye el ' (Des)Orden Global en la Era Post-EEUU ' donde predominan los nacionalismos idiosincr�ticos de Rusia/China/EEUU del trumpismo , con o sin Trump: una genuina transici�n geoestrat�gica de la \"muerte del globalismo\" a la nueva eclosi�n de los nacionalismos y sus singulares variantes y caracter�sticas. \n \nTe puede interesar:  2019: la inocultable crisis de las alianzas occidentales \nEn su libro de 2014 ' La Revuelta del P�blico y la Crisis de Autoridad en el Nuevo Milenio' , Martin Gurri �exanalista y exgerente del DNI Open Source Center de la CIA� aduce que la tecnolog�a ha trastocado el equilibrio de poder de la informaci�n entre las �lites (sic) y el p�blico empoderado por las redes sociales que han puesto de cabeza a los gobiernos/instituciones/partido pol�ticos/ multimedia de la primera y segunda revoluciones industriales. \nHoy la masiva informaci�n digitalizada ha movilizado a millones de ciudadanos en todo el planeta que han tomado desprevenida a la �lite globalista reinante. \n \n�C�mo podr�a sobrevivir el globalismo, un modelo cong�nitamente plutocr�tico de las �lites que solo benefici� al 1% de los habitantes de los pa�ses dislocados, cuando el 99% de la masa de ciudadanos irrumpe y participa con sus redes sociales, eminentemente antiglobalistas por su naturaleza propia? \n  \nLA OPINI�N DEL AUTOR NO COINCIDE NECESARIAMENTE CON LA DE

Tames, fotografi shqiptar i dhjet� president�ve t� SHBA","content":"George Tames (Xhorxh Tejms) 1919-1994, ishte pinjoll i nj� familjeje emigrant�sh t� brezit t� par� t� shqiptar�ve n� ShBA. Si p�r koincidenc�, ai lindi n� Washington D.C., n� nj� sht�pi q� ndodhej n�n hijen e Capitol Dom , pik�risht aty ku ai do t� punonte thuajse p�r gjysm� shekulli p�r gazetat �Life-Time�, �The New York Times� e revist�n e saj Sunday Magazine (Revista e s� Diel�s), etj. \n \nAi ishte m� i madhi i shtat� f�mij�ve t� familjes patriarkale q� lind�n njeri pas tjetrit dhe po t�i shtosh k�saj edhe faktin se v�llez�rit e motrat e tij erdh�n n� jet� gjat� koh�s s� Depresionit t� Madh, George-s i duhej t� mos e vazhdonte rregullisht shkoll�n e t� ndihmonte babain e tij Kristo si �irak n� pun�n e tij p�r t� p�rballuar situatat e v�shtira ekonomike familjare, q� kur ishte 8-9 vje�. Midis t� tjerash ai e p�rhin t� atin k�shtu: �� babai im ishte nj� shit�s ambulant me nj� karroc� dore dhe un� e lash� shkoll�n e lart� p�r t� punuar� Ai ishte nj� njeri i mir�. Ishte i fort� e i vrazhd�, ndaj ai nuk e kuptoi kurr� k�tu lirin� pasi vinte nga nj� shoq�ri pothuaj feudale n� Shqip�ri��. M� pas ai punoi ilegalisht si kamerier n� nj� kazino �Hot Shoppes�. \n \n1938, pra kur George ishte 19 vje�, u b� p�r t� nj� vit vendimtar n� jet�n e tij, n� t� ardhmen e tij. Ai ia dedikon k�t� nj� njeriu t� quajtur Harold J. T. Horan, i cili sapo kishte hapur nj� zyr� p�r revist�n �Time� Inc. (Nj� kompani konglomerate mediash, K.B.) dhe me iniciativ�n e vet mori si korrier zyre Georgen. Me k�t� rast, ai hyri p�r her� t� par� brenda Capitol Hill, ku u magjeps sa u harrua e q�ndroi aty gjith� dit�n e u kthye n� zyr� von� pasdite. �Ky ishte fillimi. Nj� bot� e t�r� e re hapej p�rpara�. \n \nN� vitin 1936 kompania �Times� kishte bler� edhe aksionet e revist�s �Life� (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, Time Inc.) dhe njihej tashm� si �Time-Life� (Revista �Life� ishte krijuar e botohej qysh ne vitin 1883. P�r koin�idenc�, n� vitin 1939, n� revist�n �Life� kishte filluar pun� edhe fotografi i shquar shqiptar Gjon Mili, i cili shpejt do t� konsiderohej si nj� prej fotograf�ve ekselent� bot�ror�). \n \nNd�rkaq George kishte bler� nj� aparat fotografik �Leica� dhe fotografonte �mundte, punonj�sit e zyr�s, ashtu si edhe posht� e lart. Sigurisht pa anj� m�sim profesional, vet�m n�p�rmjet provave praktike dhe gabimeve, madje duke hyr� edhe n� dhom�n e err�t laboratorike p�r t� realizuar printimet e fotove t� tij n�p�rmjet v�zhgimeve e intuit�s. \n \nK�shtu, shum� shpejt, kishte filluar nj� er� e re n� pun�n profesionale e krijuese t� George Tames. Fotografit� e para t� tij ishin ato t� njer�zve t� ndrysh�m, t� administrat�s presidenciale t� asaj kohe, senator�, kongresmen� dhe figura t� njohura t� politik�s e jet�s administrative n� Capitol Hill, t� realizuara fillimisht me ndruajtje, por q� shpejt do t� p�rcaktonin fush�n e veprimtaris� s� tij t� m�tejshme. George Tames m�soi fotografin� ashtu si� m�soi edhe historin�, politik�n, psikologjin� dhe diplomacin�: p�rmes kuriozitetit nativ, energjis� s� pashtershme dhe mund�sis� direkte ndaj burimeve m� t� mira q� askush nuk mund t�i imagjinoj�. Auditor�t e tij ishin korridoret, zyrat, dhomat e konferencave dhe mjediset e fshehta t� Capitol-it dhe m�suesit e tij ishin politikan�t t� cil�t b�nin ligjet, si dhe gazetar�t q� shkruanin p�r ta. \n \nFillimet e pun�s s� tij koinciduan, gjithashtu, me angazhimin amerikan n� Luft�n e Dyt� Bot�rore. P�r shkak t� saj shum� fotograf� e reporter� t� njohur amerikan� shkuan n� Europ�, Azi e Lindjen e Larg�t, n� terren ku zhvillohej lufta, p�r ta pasqyruar at� direkt. Pra, nj� brezi m� t� ri fotograf�sh, midis t� cil�ve edhe George Tames, iu krijua nj� mund�si m� shum� p�r t� gjetur hap�sira pune mediatike n� Shtetet e Bashkuara. Deri n� vitin 1945 ai, fal� edhe disa cil�sive e aft�sive humane p�r t�u b�r� shpejt i shoq�ruesh�m me �do njeri, pavar�sisht nga pozita e tij, p�r t� krijuar lidhje e afinitet miq�sor, p�r t� q�n� inteligjent, i hapur, i komunikuesh�m e i besuesh�m, p�r t�u p�rshtatur shpejt e natyrsh�m me njer�zit e mjedisin, p�r sensin sip�ror t� humorit dhe t� t� shprehurit intuitiv ndaj personazhit apo situat�s konkrete, p�r t� guxuar e sfiduar, por edhe duke q�ndruar e punuar shum� gjat� gjith� dit�s s� pun�s p�r t� fiksuar �do situat� politike ditore, si dhe duke mbajtur konspirative ato q� d�gjonte e nuk duhej t� merreshin vesh, ai shpejt krijoi pozicionin e vet komod midis fotogazetar�ve t� tjer� t� shumt�. Gjat� viteve q� punoi p�r �Time � Life� ai fotografoi dhe shkroi p�r shum� ngjarje, grupe njer�zish, individ�sh politik�, b�mash e faktesh t� bujshme, skandalesh, rrymash, marr�dh�niesh e konfliktesh �djathtas, a majtas� duke krijuar nj� imazh interesant t� profilit t� tij profesional dhe duke qen� i mir�pritur e i vler�suar nga qarqet politike t� Washingtonit e sidomos t� drejtuesve t� kompanis� mediatike �Time-Life�. Fotot e k�saj periudhe i kushtoheshin kryesisht presidentit Franklin D. Rusvelt dhe administrat�s s� tij. (Franklin D. Roosvelt 1882-1945, presidenti XXXII p�r 4 mandate rrjesht 1933-1945). Rusvelti ishte presidenti i par� q� ai fotografoi. \n \n�Time � Life� ai konsolidoi vendin e tij t� pun�s dhe krijoi n� mjedisin politik t� Capitol Hill-it personalitetin e tij intelektual e profesional dhe u kompletua me atmosfer�n e jet�s s� v�rtet� politike q� g�lonte n� sallat e korridoret m� t� r�nd�sishme t� politik�s globale.�Un� b�hesha shum� miq�sor me individ�. Un� isha i aft� t� punoja me ta, madje shum� her�t. B�ja miq leht�sisht, dhe k�shtu krijoja konfidenc�n e tyre. M� e r�nd�sishmja, ata e shfaqnin k�t� kur un� isha duke i fotografuar ata, sidoqoft� nuk u p�rmendja asgj� t� t� tjer�ve. Si rezultat un� kisha konfidenc�n e an�tar�ve. \n \nN� vitin 1945, atij i ofrohet nj� vend pune n� gazet�n �The New York Times�. Ai jo vet�m q� nuk e refuzoi, por e pranoi at� me kushtin e nj� page m� t� lart�, k�rkes� t� cil�n ia pranuan. Fillonte nj� kapitull i ri, m� i r�nd�sishmi, m� i gjati dhe m� vendimtari n� jet�n e tij profesionale, sociale e intelektuale, ngjarjet e t� cilit do t� zhvilloheshin, gjithsesi, n� t� nj�jtin sfond, n� t� nj�jt�n aren� politike, por tashm� n� favor t� nj� tjet�r organi mediatik, politikisht e social m� prestigjoz, �The New York Times�. Puna si fotograf lajmesh e t�rhiqte, megjith�se n� at� koh� fotograf�t nuk lejoheshin t� qarkullonin n� korridoret e Kongresit. Por, shpejt, ai u lejua t� b�nte foto individuale t� an�tar�ve t� Kongresit dhe, nga fundi i Luft�s II Bot�rore, ai ishte nga t� paktit fotograf� q� u lejuan t� fotografonin presidentin Rusvelt. Presidenca moderne amerikane fillon pik�risht me presidentin Franklin D. Rusvelt, i cili i admironte dhe i shfryt�zoi shum� fotografit� dhe mediat e shkruara e radiofonike dhe, p�r m� tep�r, sepse ai konsiderohej si njeriu q� fitoi Luft�n e Dyt� Bot�rore. Ai fitoi kat�r mandate rresht dhe e ushtroi detyr�n e presidentit p�r 12.5 vjet, deri sa u nda nga jeta duke l�n� n� mes mandatin e kat�rt. P�r shkak t� s�mundjes s� tij paralitike, aksesi fotografik ndaj tij ishte e kufizuar dhe e parap�rgatitur me kujdes, q� ai t� mos reflektonte n� foto sadopak nga s�mundja e tij. K�shtu �censura� fotografike ndaj tij ishte nj� marr�veshje etiko-morale me fotograf�t p�r t� mos e fotografuar at� kur l�vizte me karrigen e invalidit. P�r her� t� par� ai e fotografoi Rusveltin m� 1941 gjat� parad�s s� tij inauguruese dhe p�r t� fundit her� kur arkivoli i tij kthehej n� Washington nga Georgia, n� Prill t� vitit 1945. Kishte filluar k�sisoj p�r George Tames pa e menduar �maratona� 50 vje�are e fotografimit t� 10 president�ve rresht, nj� rekord Gines dhe destinacion i pamundur p�r asnj� prej fotograf�ve t� tjer� t� integruar n� Sht�pin� e Bardh�. \n \nGeorge Tames jo vet�m i ka fotografuar ata, por ka penetruar n� bot�n e tyre t� brendshme, i ka q�mtuar psikologjikisht t� gjith� n� momentet e tyre t� pun�s, t� v�shtir�sive dhe situatave t� mprehta politike, por edhe n� momente shplodh�se, familjare, intime, bisedash personale me ta gjat� procesit t� fotografimit, ve�an�risht ka interpretuar raportet e tyre me mediat, fotograf�t, reporter�t dhe i ka shkruar e botuar t� gjitha k�to mbresa me nj� mjesht�ri e pathos t� admiruesh�m objektiv letrar, profesional e human, jo si fotoreporter, por si shkrimtar i thekur, n� librin e tij autobiografik �An Eye on Washington� (Sy mbi Washingtonin) (1980), ku lexuesi mund t� m�soj� detaje t� shumta nga individualiteti, personaliteti, pikat e p�rbashk�ta e t� ve�anta t� president�ve, ngjarjet pikante historike, politike, ekonomike t� nj� gjysm� shekulli shum� turbulent, pra nj� lloj enciklopedie t� shkruar me fjal� por edhe me foto respektive. \n \nK�shtu, pas vdekjes s� Rusveltit, z�vend�si i tij Harri Truman ( Hurry S. Truman-1884-1972 presidenti XXXIII (1945-1953) i ShBA-ve mori presidenc�n. Ajo ��ka, ve� t� tjerash, George Tames-it i ka mbetur n� kujtes� mbi marr�dh�niet e Trumanit n� raport me gazetar�t e fotograf�t ka t� b�j� me faktin se si njeri i hapur e i lirsh�m ai nuk hezitonte t� takohej me gazetar�t dhe, nd�r t� tjera t� b�nte edhe humor me ta. � Ai ishte leht�sisht i komunikuesh�m edhe p�r pun�n e fotoreporter�ve dhe mbante me ta raporte t� ve�anta respekti e afeksioni profesional, por edhe human. Midis t� tjerash, Presidenti Truman krijoi �One More Club� dhe e konsideroi veten si president t� tij� Ai ishte krenar me t�. Kur n� Sht�pin� e Bardh� vinin vizitor� ai i uronte ata formalisht dhe pask�taj rrotullohej n� m�nyr� q� t�ju krijonte mund�sin� fotograf�ve p�r t� b�r� nj� foto t� mir�. Ai ju thoshte vizitor�ve: K�ta jan� miqt� e mi; jan� an�tar� t� �One More Club� dhe p�rve� se un� jam president i Shteteve t� Bashkuara, jam edhe president i �One More Club��dhe shtonte: edhe pse un� jam president i Shteteve t� Bashkuara dhe kryekomandant i kombit m� t� fuqish�m n� bot�, un� nuk marr urdh�ra nga asnj�, p�rve� fotograf�ve� pas mbarimit t� mandateve presidenciale ndodhte q� kur ai takohej me mua, m� thosh: Si ia kalon, George? Si jan� djemt� e mi? Si jan� miqt� e �One More Club�?� �Ky president ishte i pari q� i kushtoi interes problemeve teknike e personale t� fotoreporter�ve. Z�ri i tij hundor, i but�, i that� dhe i ngadalt�, veprimet e gjestet e panxituara synonin t�i vendosnin fotograf�t n� leht�si e shkujdesje, t� cilat ishin nj� �el�s modestie. Ne punonim me nj� dijeni se ky burr� mund t� b�nte l�shime ndaj vetes p�r t� na b�r� t� mundur ne realizimin e fotove�. \n \n� Presidenti Truman ishte pa dyshim i preferuari i Georges, pasi ai ishte i pari q� i trajtoi fotograf�t me respekt e kujdes t� ve�ant�. Tames p�lqen t� kujtoj� faktin q� Truman �i b�ri fotograf�t e Sht�pis� s� Bardh� qytetar� t� klasit t� par�� nga zhvendosja e tyre prej dhom�s s� vog�l n� krahun per�ndimor e quajtur �stela e qenit� n� t� drejt�n p�r t� q�ndruar n� dhom�n e shtypit. \n \nTrumani i admironte mediat dhe ju besonte fotograf�ve� Sipas vet� Tames: �Presidenti Truman relaksohej leht�sisht, qeshte kollaj, jetonte pa teklif p�rball� kamer�s. Ai ishte vetvetja, miq�sor, llafazan, por i vet�dijsh�m.)�(Po aty). \n \nMegjithat�, 28-30 vje�ar, Tames reflektonte nj� karakter dhe nj� personalitet t� pjekur intelektual e profesional, nj� talent e maturi mjesht�rore, ai u b� qysh at�here nj� prej fotograf�ve e fotoreporter�ve m� t� af�rt e protagonist t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh�, akumuloi nj� p�rvoj� politike, kulturore e etike t� lakmueshme, t� cilat, s� bashku i krijuan edhe nj� dhunti humane, at� t� krijimit t� nj� bagazhi t� madh kujtimesh e reflektimesh profesionale, politike, intelektuale e humane, t� cilat ai do t�i p�rgjith�sonte m� von� n� kujtimet e tij t� vyera. \n \ntjet�r ndjeshm�ri e q�ndrim mbajti presidenti pasardh�s, Ajzenauer (David Dwight Eisenhower, (1890�1969). presidenti XXXIV i ShBA-ve, dy mandate 1953-1961) ndaj fotograf�ve dhe reporter�ve. Ai �sht� konsideruar jo aq i hapur e dashamir�s me fotograf�t, mbasi fillimisht i konsideronte ata si njer�s t� pakultivuar denj�sisht dhe nd�rmori nj� veprim disi radikal duke mbyllur kontaktin e drejtp�rdrejt� me ta e duke vendosur midis tij dhe tyre nj� barrier� institucionale, at� t� sekretarit t� shtypit q� kufizonte kontaktet dhe mund�sit� e fotograf�ve p�r m� shum� liri komunikimi. ��Politika e Sht�pis� s� Bardh� p�r t�i b�r� t� shurdh�r fotograf�t n� zyr�n e presidentit u formalizua nga Ajzenaueri. ?do fjal� ishte e privilegjuar, duke p�rfshir� edhe bashk�bisedimet me ne�. Megjithat�, George Tames krijoi marr�dh�nie korrekte e mq�sore me Ajzenauer-in, i cili e vler�soi gjithashtu fotografin si nj� nga m� t� mir�t e Sht�pis� s� Bardh�. Nga t� kat�r fotoportretet zyrtare t� presidentit, tre prej tyre ishin realizime t� George Tames, madje me njer�n prej tyre (ajo e vitit 1953) u printua m� 1970 emisioni i pull�s respektive p�r nder t� tij. Po ashtu foto t� r�nd�sishme u konsideruan ato t� �panikut t� drithit n� Kansas�, si dhe ato q� lidheshin me armatimet me rreze t� gjat� veprimi, q� konfirmonin ashp�rsimin e Luft�s s� Ftoht�. \n \nPresidenca e Xhon Kenedit (John Fitzgerald �Jack� Kennedy (1917-1963 XXXV i SHBA) u konsiderua si ajo e nj� brezi t� ri amerikan�sh. Xhon Kenedi u b� p�r amerikan�t simboli i nj� bote dhe shprese t� re humane, sidomos i brezave t� rinj. Tames kujton se e lidhnin me Kenedin ndjenja t� ve�anta afeksioni. Kenedi ishte vet�m dy vjet m� i madh se ai, ndaj shpesh diskutonin p�r shpres�n dhe t� ardhmen e tyre, ashtu si edhe, kryesisht, ndanin t� nj�jt�n filozofi politike e �ndrra� George Tames kujton se �Roli im n� mbret�rin� e politik�s ishte jozyrtar, e nj� shakaxhiu dhe reporteri thashethemaxhi i v�rtet�, pasi un� fotografoja Kenedin si dhe stafin e tij t� ri, t� etur, efi�ient e luajal. Ata, un� dhe miliona amerikan� t� tjer� besonin n� magjin� e nj� njeriu t� bekuar me nj� hir t� ve�ant� mendjeje e veprimi�. \n \nAksioni politik i Kenedit kundrejt Luft�s s� Ftoht�, ngjarjet delikate n� marr�dh�niet me Kub�n e ish Bashkimin Sovjetik i dhan� fotografit Tames terrenin p�r nj� aktivizim t� ngjeshur profesional pasi mbulimi i shtypit nga Kenedi ishte i favorsh�m. Shum� reporter� dhe fotograf� e kishin njohur at� si kongresmen e senator duke krijuar marr�dh�nie t� cilat vijuan gjat� presidenc�s s� tij, k�shtu ishte e leht� t� flisje me t�, t� b�je shaka dhe t� konkludoje se Sht�pia e Bardh� ishte nj� vend i p�rshtatsh�m. Presidenti Kenedi ishte i ndjesh�m ndaj sugjerimeve t� reporter�ve ose fotograf�ve mbi historit� e mundshme t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh�. K�rkesat e filtruara n�p�rmjet Zyr�s s� Shtypit, e obligonin at� t� ftonte reporterin apo fotografin, ideja e t� cil�ve i p�lqente dhe m� tej e diskutonin at� m� thell�, apo e vinin n� zbatim. \n \nP�r George Tames kjo periudh� sh�non kulmin e suksesin m� t� madh n� veprimtarin� e tij si fotogazetar, kur ai u b� bot�risht edhe m� i famsh�m. Vajza e tij, Stephanie, thot� se n� sht�pin� ton� kishte aq shum� foto t� Kenedit t� varura n� mure, sa neve na dukej sikur ishim pjes�tar� t� familjes s� tij. Mbulimi i shtypit nga Kenedi ishte i favorsh�m. Shum� reporter� dhe fotograf� e kishin njohur at� si kongresmen e senator duke krijuar marr�dh�nie t� cilat vijuan gjat� presidenc�s s� tij, k�shtu ishte e leht� t� flisje me t�, t� b�je shaka dhe t� konkludoje se Sht�pia e Bardh� ishte nj� vend i lumtur. \n \nObsesioni i presidentit Kenedi me vendosjen e nj� imazhi rinor mbeti me t� gjithmon�. Nj� nga g�zimet e fotograf�ve t� shoq�rimit me Kenedin ishte kaosi i duksh�m q� pasonte. Q�ndrimet e paplanifikuara dhe ngjarjet e paparashikuara iu dhan� fotograf�ve disa nga fotot m� t� bukura. \n \nPresidenti Kenedi ishte i ndjesh�m ndaj sugjerimeve t� reporter�ve ose fotograf�ve mbi historit� e mundshme t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh�. K�rkesat e filtruara n�p�rmjet Zyr�s s� Shtypit, e obligonin at� t� ftonte reporterin apo fotografin, ideja e t� cil�ve i p�lqente dhe m� tej e diskutonin at� m� thell�, apo e vinin n� zbatim. \n \nPo, mbi t� gjitha, nj� foto e pazakont�, unike, origjinale, e pap�rs�ritshme, sensacionale, q� ka thyer �do skem� imagjinate dhe �kanune� fotografike ndaj nj� presidenti, por edhe sepse ajo do t� ngjallte dhe shum� e diskutueshme, komente, interpretime, q� kumboi fort e u b� simbol e p�rgjith�sim i vlerave, p�rgjegj�sive, r�nd�sis�, fuqis�, solemnitetit e humanizmit t� �do presidenti amerikan �shte ajo me titull �Puna m� e vetmuar n� bot�� (1961). ( Shih Balli.K. �Nj� Foto Bot�rore Presidenciale� Gazeta �Telegraf�, 17 Mars 2015, f. 16). Kjo foto u popullarizua n� m�nyr� eksponenciale n� Amerik� dhe n� shum� vende t� bot�s jo vet�m p�r vlerat e saj politike e humane, por edhe p�r ato profesionale, artistike e estetike. �sht� b�r� tashm� nj� rregull i pashkruar q� kjo foto q�ndron e varur n� zyr�n ovale dhe �do president e �imiton� at� me nj� shkrepje speciale gjat� mandatit t� vet. Gjithashtu, Tames pati marr�dh�nie miq�sore me gruan e Kenedit, Zhaklin�n dhe e konsiduar si shum� inteligjente, �magjeps�se� e fotozhenike, por edhe sepse ajo rikonstruktoi sipas shijeve t� saj nj� pjes� t� sht�pis� s� Bardh� dhe organizonte eventet sociale, ai i ka rezervuar foto t� shumta, kryesisht jozyrtare. Miq�sin� me t� ai e mbajti edhe pas tragjedis� s� Kenedit. \n \nLindon Xhonson (Lyndon Baines Johnson , 27 Gusht 1908 �22 Janar 1973 presidenti XXXVI i ShBA-ve (1963�1969) kishte nj� afeksion t� ve�ant� p�r fotografit�, sidomos p�r ato q� lidheshn me statur�n e tij politike e humane, por edhe me nj� pamje sa m� fotozhenike e imponuese. N� k�t� kontekst George Tames e kishte studiuar e zhbiruar thell� Xhonsonin shum� koh� m� par�, pasi ai ishte i vetmi q� i kishte kaluar t� gjitha pozicionet politike n� Capitol Hill dhe Sht�pin� e Bardh�. Madje George Tames thosh se e kishte mik Xhonsonin. �Mund t� b�ja shaka me t� apo t�i tregoja ndonj� skandal q� d�gjoja ose mblidhja rreth Capitol Hill dhe t�i tregoja anekdoda dhe ai do t� qeshte.� George e p�rcakton Xhonsonin si humorist t� thekur e t� referuar si �i shthurur Teksasi�; shakat� seksiste nuk mund t� p�rs�ritesh�n m� mir� jasht� qarqeve t� mbyllura q� i d�gjonin ato. N� t� v�rtet�, sensi i tij i humorit nuk kishte limit. Por, kur vinte puna p�r fotot e botuara n� New York Times, ai i kritikonte dhe e faj�sonte fotografin n�se ato nuk i p�lqenin. P�rse nuk m� b�jn� foto t� mira si Kenedit, ankohej ai dhe i hidhte n� dysheme fotot qi i vinin p�rpara n� tavolin�. \n \nXhonsoni kishte obsesionin e t� p�lqyerit t� fotove q� e paraqitnin at� nga ana e majt� e fytyr�s dhe sa her� fotografohej p�rpiqej q�, me marifet, t� pozicionohej nga ajo an�, madje edhe kur fotografohej me persona t� tjer�. \n \nAi shprehte interes t� ve�ant� p�r t�u paraqitur n� New York Times sa m� mir�, k�shtu ai u p�rpoq q� t�u sugjeronte e kultivonte fotograf�ve dhe reporter�ve k�t� syninm estetik t� tij. Nd�rkaq Georgen e kishte caktuar si p�rgjegj�s p�r t� gjitha fotot q� botoheshin n� New York Times, pavar�sisht se kush i kishte realizuar. Nuk falej edhe n�se ato ishin t� t� tjer�ve. �George, i thosh ai, ti je miku im. Ti duhet t� kujdesesh q� fotot e mia t� jen� t� mira.� Ai ishte i pari q� krijoi stafin e fotograf�ve n� Hill kundrejt d�shir�s s� madhe t� tij p�r t�u fotografuar. Ai ishte i vet�dijsh�m p�r fotografit�. \n \nXhonson i la autografin e tij n� nj� foto personale t� realizuar nga G. Tames: �George Tames, i cili m� m�soi gjith�ka un� njoha rreth modestis�� \n \n�George ishte i ndrysh�m�, thosh Jim Mones-drejtor i fotoarkiv�s s� New York Times. �Ai ishte nj� shakaxhi, i madh n� thashetheme, tregimin e historive, nj� qeshje e madhe. Ai mund t� ishte jeta e nj� feste, ai mund t� zinte miq�si me ata senator� q� u b�n� president�. Ata t� gjith� e njihnin dhe e donin. George ishte i aft� t� b�hej i af�rt me njer�zit, politikan�t, sidomos president�t�. \n \nVitet e m�tejshme karakterizohen nga zhvillimi marramend�s i televizionit, i cili ndryshoi shum� �kanune� tradicionale t� fofogazetaris�. I zbatuar n� m�nyr� eksperimentale por shum� t� shpejt� q� n� mesin e viteve 1950 kjo teknologji elektronike shum� komode p�r t� ofruar informacion direkt n� �do sht�pi amerikane konkuroi me shum� sukses, por edhe ashp�rsisht mbi masmediat e tjera t� shkruara q� i pasqyronin ngjarjet politike, ekonomike e sociale relativisht me vones�. Miliona amerikan� kishin mund�sin� e nj� aparati televiziv q� t� servirte n� p�ll�mb� t� dor�s gjith� zhvillimet e fresk�ta amerikane e bot�rore. N� k�t� kontekst interesi p�r mediat e shkruara u zvog�lua dhe, p�r k�t� arsye, shum� prej tyre falimentuan apo ishin n� prag falimentimi. Sidoqoft�, n� k�t� larushani kaotike informacioni, fotogazetaria e organeve mediatike t� famshme n� bot�, si� ishte edhe The New York Times, e ndodhur n�n presionin elektronik, iu n�n�shtrua strategjive bashk�kohore t� reformimit dhe nuk u asimilua. U shfryt�zuan t� tjera hap�sira t� pa p�rdorura deri at�here, sidomos t� fotoportretit e eses� interpretuese q�, jo vet�m pasqyronin sakt�sisht ngjarjet, personazhet, jet�n politike e ekonomike, por b�nin interpretime e analiza rreth tyre. Nga ana tjet�r teknologjia televizive ishte ende �nj� moll� e ndaluar� p�r shumic�n e njer�zimit jasht� Amerik�s dhe mediat e shkruara kishin ende treg konsumi n� k�t� pjes� tjet�r t� Bot�s. \n \nMb�rrijm�, k�shtu, n� vitin 1969, vit n� t� cilin zyr�n ovale do ta zot�ronte p�r rreth 5 vjet Ri�ard Nikson (Richard Milhous Nixon, 1913-1994, president XXXVII i SHBA-ve, i pari dhe i vetmi president amerikan q� ka dh�n� dor�heqjen n� fillim t� mandatit t� dyt�, 1974). Mbrritja e njeriut n� H�n�, p�rshkall�zimi dhe m� pas kufizimi i konfliktit n� Vietnam, vizita n� Kin� e BRSS n� tentative p�r t� qet�suar e stabilizuar luft�n e ftoht�, kriza n� Lindjen e Mesme, skandali i Watergate, i cili e detyroi t� jepte dor�heqjen ishin disa prej ngjarjeve nd�rkomb�tare me t� cilat do t� p�rballej Niksoni. \n \nFotografikisht, ai, m� shum� se �do president tjet�r aplikoi �photo opp� (photo opportunity � mund�si fotografimi) \n \n�P�r ndjekjen e fushat�s (p�r zv.president t� R. Niksonit, m� 1953 New York Times kishte angazhuar 5 reporter� si dhe fotografin George Tames, i cili do t� b�hej m� von� i famsh�m me portretin siluet� t� presidentit Kenedi)73) \n \nRreth nj� interviste dhe disa fotove q� George Tames i ka b�r� Richard Nikson-it n� �ikago (kur ai ende ishte senator) gjat� fushat�s s� tij elektorale p�r zv.president, njihemi me ngjarjen se si Nikson e ka ftuar Georgen p�r t� ngr�n� bashk� m�ngjesin e t� bisedonin m� gjat� e miq�sisht rreth situat�s dhe t� tatimit t� parashikimeve t� mundshme rreth kandidat�ve. P�r her� t� par� George e kishte takuar Niksonin si an�tar i Sht�pis� s� P�rfaq�suesve, i kishte b�r� her�t disa foto duke sh�titur me bi�iklet� me gruan e tij rreth basenit Tidal n� pranver�n e vitit 1947, kur kishin �elur qershit�. �Ai ndaloi duke m� th�n� se m� njihte qysh nga Kapitol Hill. Un� ndihesha i k�naqur, sidomos kur ai m� ftoi n� zyr�n e tij p�r t� m� shprehur mir�njohjen e njohjes n� Hill, t� cil�n un� duhej ta pranoja, e vler�suar shum� pak gjat� asaj kohe. Ai m� impresionoi at�here si nj� kongresmen shum� pun�tor, energjik, konservativ i klasit t� par� t� asaj kohe n� qend�r djathtas, me politika q� evokonin pozicionet standarde Republikane n� favor t� m� pak burokracie dhe m� shum� t� drejta individuale shtet�rore. Dhe kur ai mbrriti n� ��shtjet e jashtme, spektri ogurzi i komunizmit nd�rkomb�tar ishte n� qend�r t� v�mendjes s� tij� \n \nPrirja e Georges p�r humor e befasonte Niksonin, madje kur George b�nte ndonj� konstatim sarkastik p�r ndonj� figur� politike, Niksoni ia besonte fjal�t si prej ungjilli, ndaj George detyrohej t�i spjegonte se ajo ishte nj� shaka, apo ishte di�ka p�r t� qeshur q� ai e kishte d�gjuar posht� e lart n� Hill at� dit�. \n \nNikson ishte nj� njeri zhbirues dhe fotoreporter�t ndjenin se ai kishte qejf t� fotografohej dhe krijonte mund�sin� q� t�i joshte ata. \n \nGeorge e ka shoq�ruar Niksonin si zv. President me 1954 n� fushat�n mbar�komb�tare p�r formimin e nj� Kongresi Republikan, fushat� e cila d�shtoi e gjat� s� cil�s George realizoi mjaft �foto opp� p�r t�. \n \nViteve q� Niksoni punoi n� Capitol Hill, si kongresmen dhe, m� pas, si senator, ai kishte lidhje t� p�rzem�rta me reporter�t dhe akoma m� t� ngrohta e m� personale me fotograf�t. Mund�sia dhe dashamir�sia p�r t� akomoduar fotograf�t rezultoi me nj� publicitet t� gjer� personal sidomos gjat� shqyrtimit t� Komitetit t� Aktiviteteteve Kund�r Amerikane. \n \nGjat� periudh�s s� tij si senator dhe zv.president ai i ftonte fotograf�t n� sht�pi p�r raste shoq�rore e familiare� Marr�dh�niet e p�rzem�rta me fotograf�t vazhduan edhe gjat� fushat�s s� tij t� pasuksesshme p�r president me 1960 dhe m� pas, deri sa ai u b� krejt i izoluar nga shtypi kund�rshtar. \n \nN� kujtimet e tij, G. Tames tregon: �Niksoni i vitit 1947 ishte m� koherent me bot�n dhe me veten. Niksoni i Watergate-it ishte nj� njeri i izoluar nga realiteti, kontradiktor me shtypin gjat� dit�ve t� betej�s me administrat�n dhe revanshin e Watergat-it dhe u maskua� N� dy vitet e fundit para dor�heqjes s� turpshme, atmosfera p�rreth Sht�pis� s� Bardh� t� Niksonit ishte ajo e nj� kampi ushtarak n� rrethim. Zyra e shtypit ishte nj� enklav� e rrethuar nga nj� territor kund�rshtar�, vet�m me nj� zon� neutrale kalimi q� e b�nin t� pamundur veprimtarin� e shtypit. Rregullat e jashtzakonshme u p�rforcuan me roje q� raportonin ndonj� devijim nga shtigjet e presidentit prej ndonj� an�tari t� shtypit. Kontakti me stafin e Sht�pis� s� Bardh� u kufizua, shpesh nuk ekzistonte� Nuk jam i sigurt, psh, n� se dikush nga mediat ftohej nat�n t� takonte Niksonin apo bashk�pun�tor�t e tij n� ndonj� tavolin� t� rrumbullak�t informale p�r ngjarjet e dit�s, si� ndodhte me presidentin Kenedi dhe Xhonson. Kur ai u gjend n� v�shtir�si, nuk kishte asnj� nga media q� t� njihte Niksonin e v�rtet�, q�nien e tij humane. Izolimi i tij dhe m�nyra noprane e �oi n� keqinterpretimin dhe keqkuptimin m� t� madh�. \n \nGeorge Tames i p�rshkruan me p�rpikm�ri dhe objektivitet nga pikpamja e fotoreporterit me barometrin e tij profesional e politik, tashm� t� b�r� mjaft t� ndjesh�m e diktuesh�m n� atmosfer�n presidenciale t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh� t� Niksonit, se e ardhmja dhe fundi i Niksonit ishte ��shtje kohe dhe se ai e v�rtetonte k�t� edhe me sjelljen e tij ndaj shtypit, ve�an�risht me revist�n The new York Times, ku G. Tames ishte protagonist i saj edhe n� zyr�n presidenciale. \n \nGeorge Tames ka realizuar nj� galeri t� t�r� fotosh e shkrimesh p�r m� se 25 vjet n� t� cilat ai e kishte njohur Niksonin. Fotot e fundit ai i shkrepi dit�n e dor�heqjes publike dhe largimit t� tij me helikopter, po ashtu edhe t� stafit t� tij t� madh n� verand�n e Sht�pis� s� Bardh�. \n \nNj� nga fotot m� t� paharruara t� Niksonit, realizuar nga G.Tames, ishte ajo kur Nikson ishte zv.president i Ajzenauerit, dhe ku ai shfaqej me udh�heq�sin sovjetik Nikita Hrushov �n� debatin� ku u ngrin� kredencialet e politik�s s� jashtme. Tames kujton gjithashtu se si ndjenja dramatike e b�ri at� subjekt t� admiruesh�m. M� her�t, fotograf�t e kishin ndier q� Nikson e d�shironte b�rjen e fotove dhe �ai gjeti nj� m�nyr� p�r t� na obliguar ne m� tej�. Si p�rfundim, Tames realizoi shum� fotografi kujtimore t� Niksonit gjat� karierave t� gjata q� ata pat�n. \n \nGerald Ford (Gerald Ford , 1913-2006, presidenti i XXXVIII i SHBA-ve, 1974-1977, kishte sh�rbyer paraprakisht si Zv.president XXXX m� 1969-1974. Si president Fordi firmosi �Marr�veshjen e Helsinkit� q� sh�noi zbutjen e Luft�s s� Ftoht�. Nd�rhyrja n� Vietnam pothuajse u nd�rpre. K�mb�nguli p�r forcimin e rolit t� Kongresit ndaj politik�s s� jashtme dhe respektivisht t� rolit t� presidentit n� k�t� fush�. Ford udh�hoqi gjithashtu nd�rhyrjet n� ngjarjet dhe konfliktet rajonale t� Lindjes s� Mesme dhe Lindjes s� Larg�t.), si zv. president i Niksonit, mori detyr�n e presidentit pasardh�s, menj�her� pas dor�heqjes s� Niksonit, t� cilin e p�rcolli n� fluturimin e largimit t� tij. \n \nMenj�her� pas em�rimit t� tij si president edhe situata mediatike, midis t� tjerash, ndryshoi dhe liria e atmosfera e ushtrimit t� profesionit dhe l�vizjeve brenda Sht�pis� s� Bardh� dhe sidomos n� Zyr�n e Shtypit u �liruan nga terri dhe kaosi m� se dyvje�ar q� kishte krijuar Skandali i Watergate-it. \n \nXher�lld Ford kishte qen� gjithashtu kongresmen dhe kryetar i grupit t� minoranc�s republikane dhe ishte i njohur nga Tames thuajse prej m� se 25 vitesh. Sipas vet� Tamesit, ai nuk e imagjinonte se nj� dit� ai do t�i adresohej atij �Zoti President�. \n \nHer�t George u b� i njohur me Fordin kur at� e caktuan t� p�rshkruante �Nj� dit� n� jet�n e Gerald Ford�, udh�heq�si i minoranc�s n� Sht�pin� e Bardh�. Regjimi i tij ditor fillonte n� or�n 6 t� m�ngjesit me gjys�m ore ushtrime fizike dhe, pastaj not n� pishin�n e tij t� ngroht�, bashk� me qenin. Lexonte shtypin e dit�s dhe para or�s tet� ndodhej n� Zyr�n Ovale. Tames e fotografoi p�r �do veprim. Si gjith� president�t, edhe Fordi do t� b�hej �viktim�� e fotografimit. \n \nN� muajin prill 1975 The New York Times botoi nj� artikull prej 21 faqesh rreth presidentit Ford. �Ai b�nte 20 ulje-ngritje(pompa) dhe 20 ulje-ngritje t� torsit t� tij, lexohet prapa fotos q� i ka b�r� George Tames. �Ai (Gerald Ford) thot� se e zinte gjumi p�r 10 sekonda, b�nte 5 or� gjum� t� thell� dhe �ohej shum� i fresk�t.� \n \nEdhe marr�dh�niet fotografike t� Georges me gruan e tij Beti ishin shum� t� ngrohta e njer�zore, pasi ajo ishte nj� zonj� me nj� natyr� t� dashur, t� gjall�, e k�ndshme, zem�rbardh�. George i b�ri asaj mjaft foto shoq�rore. \n \nDy jav� para p�rfundimit t� detyr�s, George realizoi disa foto t� Fordit n� Rose Garden. Sipas kujtimeve t� vet� G. Tames: �Un� nuk mund ta ndihmoja dot q� ai t� zgjidhej p�r nj� mandat presidencial t� tijin. Dy vjet e gjys�m jan� nj� koh� tep�r e shkurt�r p�r t� b�r� nj� vler�sim p�rfundimtar presidencial. Ne kemi qen� miq p�r m� se 30 vjet dhe un� e rendit at� s� bashku me Xhon Kenedin dhe Harri Truman-in, si nj� nga tre president�t e mi t� preferuar. \n \nXhimi Karter (Jimmy Carter, 1924, president XXXIX i ShBA �ve (1977-1981), ishte po ashtu i njohur i vjet�r i Georges. Ai e kujton me k�t� rast nj� pasdite vizite n� sht�pin� e n�n�s s� kandidatit p�r president n� shtetin Georgia, ku piqej peshk i sapogjuajtur n� liqenin e vog�l t� sht�pis� s� saj e ku u realizua nj� seri fotografish lirike e familiare. P�rshtypjet e Tames-it p�r k�t� kandidat e president ishin t� mira dhe mbet�n po ashtu. Nj� njeri i kthjell�t, i matur, i ndersh�m dhe konsiderues ndaj t� tjer�ve, ai dukej edhe me influenc� fetare. Por, midis t� tjerash, ai e konsideronte fotografin� si nj� gj� t� tep�rt, t� tejkaluar. Dukej se nuk ishte i dashuruar pas pamjes fizike, pas imazhit fotografik, por m� tep�r pas fjal�ve t� shkruara rreth karrier�s s� tij politike. \n \nK�shtu, ilustrimi viziv i Karterit n� momente t� ve�anta psikologjikisht t� bukura, t� natyr�s s� tij t� dashur, t� thell�sis� n� mendime, t� besimit t� tij, por sidomos t� momenteve t� r�nda e t� v�shtira gjat� detyr�s s� tij, sidomos gjat� d�shtimeve t� tij si ajo e lirimit t� pengjeve n� Iran, nuk u realizua plot�sisht. Ai trishtohej privatisht, kur i nevojitej simpati publike. \n \nGeorge Tames ka qen� d�shmitar okular dhe fotograf shoq�rues i nat�s s� shpalljes s� fitores s� Karterit kund�r Fordit, e cila �sht� shoq�ruar me nj� fest� t� v�rtet� dhe n� nj� festival fotosh, ashtu si kund�r ka qen� edhe d�shmitar i dit�s s� humbjes s� tij p�r mandatin e dyt� m� 1980, kur per�ndoi edhe dielli i karier�s presidenciale t� Xhimi Karterit. \n \nGeorge Tames ka realizuar p�r k�t� personalitet t� madh amerikan nj� album t� madh fotosh zyrtare, mediatike e familiare. \n \nEkspozita e Bibliotek�s �Henderson� u �el (1-28 Shkurt 2013) p�r nder t� fjalimit t� fundit t� ish presidentit Xhimi Karter dhe zonj�s s� par� Rozalin Karter, si dhe n� respektim t� Dit�s s� President�ve q� celebrohet �do vit t� H�n�n e tret� t� muajit shkurt. Eksponatet e Artikujve e Letrave t� president�ve, kujtimet presidenciale, fotot presidenciale nga fotografi i famsh�m presidencial George Tames (p�rfshir� edhe fotografin� shum� t� njohur �Puna m� e Vetmuar� t� Xhon Kenedit), nj� p�rzgjedhje t� librave t� Xhimi Karterit dhe botimet e Xhorxhias Jugore q� dokumentonin vizitat e m�parshme t� Karterit n� Xhorxhian Jugore dhe puna e r�nd�sishme ndaj drejt�sis� sociale ishin objekte t� ekspozit�s. \n \nRonald Regan (Ronald Reagan, 1911-2004, presidenti XXXX i ShBA-ve me dy mandate 1981-1989. Ka qen� guvernator dhe aktor hollivudian filmash e televizioni. Presidenca e tij shoq�rohet me implementimin e iniciativave politike e ekonomike gjith�p�rfshir�se, rritjen ekonomike, uljen e inflancionit, reduktimin e taksave, uljen e shpenzimeve qeveritare,etj. N� mandatine tij t� dyt� kundrejt politik�s s� jashtme sh�noi mbarimin e Luft�s s� Ftoht�, bombardimin e Libis�(1986), hakmarrjen kund�r Iranit. Duke e quajtur Bashkimin Sovjetik si Perandori t� Djallit, mb�shteti l�vizjet antikomuniste n� mbar� bot�n. Iu atribua merit� e ve�ant� p�r gjenerimin e nj� rilindjeje ideologjike mbi t� drejt�n politike amerikane.�) \n \nPor, ka mb�rritur nj� etap� q�, p�rs�ri e p�rgjithmon�, fotograf�t t� mos ken� akses t� pakufizuar tek president�t. Shum�llojshm�ria e fotograf�ve t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh�, gazetave, revistave, rrjetet televizive dhe stacionet private e kan� b�r� shum� t� v�shtir� e t� pamundur realizimin e fotove, madje edhe kur b�het marr�veshje p�r t� marr� nga koha e presidentit qoft� edhe 5 minuta p�r k�t� q�llim. �Ky �sht� nj� show fantastik� thosh George Tames n� at� koh�. \n \nRegan, sidoqoft�, ndjehej jo fort komod me k�t� lloj fotografie. Fotograf�t me v�shtir�si mund t� b�nin vet�m nj� shkrepje, e mir�, apo e dob�t; e botueshme apo jo. \n \nRegan e shprehte hapur se fotografia ishte nj� �ast i ngrir�, nj� shtirje, apo spontanitet ku nuk mund t� shfaqje gjith�ka nga ndjenjat e bota jote e brendshme. Filmi dhe televizioni, sipas tij ishin m� komod�, m� komunikativ�, pasi shoq�roheshin me l�vizje por edhe me fjal� e ku njeriu mund t� shprehte mir� vetveten, pamjen e brendin� e tij. \n \nN� kujtes�n e tij profesionale e humane George Tames e vendos presidentin Regan n� tipat e personaliteteve q� nuk i vler�sonte objektivisht, ishte irracional, n�nvleft�sues, inert, alergjik, mosp�rfill�s. Si produkt i fush�s kinematografike, ai konsideronte superior televizionin dhe filmin. Andaj ai realizonte fjalimet direkte n� TV q� t� shihej e t� d�gjohej nga votuesit n� dhomat e ndenjes. Dhe kjo u b� nj� loj� politike. T� gjitha k�to George i p�rhin me shembuj n� disa raste, madje edhe me humor kur ai d�rgohej nga revista e tij, apo nga organ tjet�r p�r seanca fotografimi si n� rastin e rubrik�s tradicionale �The Mind of President� (Kujtesa e Presidentit) q� bazohej, si p�r �do president tjet�r, n� dhjet� librat m� t� preferuar t� presidentit e q�, p�r rastin e Reganit, George dyshonte me humor se personazhi i tij nuk kishte lexuar gjat� jet�s s� tij dhjet� libra, apo n� rastn kur fotografi d�rgohej p�r nj� foto zyrtare e klienti i tij me shum� kund�rshtim e refuzonte nj� shkrepje t� till�, derisa shfaqte pak�naq�sin� dhe bezdin� ndaj fotografit� \n \nFoton m� t� mir� George ia kish b�r� Reganit n� nj� ikje t� till� d�shp�ruese, nga jasht� der�s s� hapur t� Zyr�s Ovale, rast�sisht me nj� lente 85 mm q� u botua n� nj� faqe t� plot� t� revist�s The New York Times t� s� Diel�s, foto q� u b� shum� e k�rkuar, sepse u konsiderua si nj� nga m� t� sinqertat e m� t� realizuarat e k�tij presidenti. \n \nGjithashtu, nj� mbres� e pashlyeshme e Georges p�rb�nte fakti q� Regani ishte presidenti q� vishej shum� bukur, shik, i p�rpikt� n� mod� e estetikisht, i nd�rronte dy her� n� dit� kostumet e tij dhe mbetej, pa dyshim, presidenti i veshur m� mir� gjat� gjith� historis� presidenciale amerikane. \n \nRegani mish�roi parashikimin e presidentit Truman q� nj� kandidat i suksessh�nm duhet t� jet� 70% aktor dhe vet�m 30% i zoti. \n \nMund�sia m� e mir� p�r t� fotografuar presidentin ishte gjat� udh�timeve e vizitave n� ngjarje t� ndryshme. Por edhe aty, �kur ne arrinim, �do spot televiziv ishte realizuar. Ne gjithmon� p�rpiqeshim dhe �luftonim� minut�n e fundit dhe nuk mund t� pretendoje t� b�je dot ndonj� foto t� mir녔. \n \nNj� pun�sim n� Sht�pin� e Bardh� b�het nj� sfid� �m� pak fotografike� ndaj durimit t� fotograf�ve. Nj� fotograf mund t� rrij� e t� pres� n� Sht�pin� e Bardh� p�r dit� t� t�ra q� t� thirret p�r t� b�r� nj� foto, e cila zgjat vet�m disa minuta. \n \nFotot dhe videoklipet p�r presidentin Regan jan� m� shum� rezultat i nj� �foto opp� i ekipit t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh�. Nj� shpur� fotograf�sh ftohen n� pranin� e presidentit Regan dhe, m� pas, dalin p�rs�ri me kujdes p�r t� mos tejkaluar koh�n e fotografimit. Fotograf�t t� cil�t vijn� v�rdall� p�r nj� apo dy poza ekstra ballafaqohen me sh�rbimin sekret q� zor se i lejon ta kryejn� at�. Sidoqoft� detyra duhej b�r�, pasioni ishte edhe m� mbizot�rues. K�tij q�llimi i sh�rbeu formimi nga G. Tames dhe Michael Evans (fotograf i Sht�pis� s� Bardh�) i nj� grupi fotograf�sh t� cil�suar si �Turfbuilders�. Q�llimi i k�tij grupi t� themeluar me �bekimin� e presidentit Regan ishte mbulimi i udh�timeve presidenciale jasht� shtetit nga fotograf� me rrotacion. \n \nXhorxh H. W. Bush (George H.W. Bush 1924-2018 �sht� presidenti XXXXI i ShBA-ve 1989-1993. Ishte aviatori m� i ri i ushtris� amerikane gjat� Luft�s II Bot�rore, ku ai u rreshtua deri n� fundin e saj dhe milioner nafte n� mosh�n 40 vje�are. Ka qen� an�tar i Sht�pis� s� P�rfaq�suesve, senator dhe drejtor i Central Inteligence (Inteligjenc�s Qendrore). Politika e jashtme p�rfshiu aksionet e Panamas� dhe t� Gjirit Persik, r�nien e murit t� Berlinit(1989) dhe shp�rb�rjen e Bashkimit Sovjetik dy vjet m� von�. N� politik�n e brendshme ekonomike, p�r shkak t� ekonomis� s� paq�ndrueshme, defi�itit t� madh buxhetor e recesionit ai rriti taksat dhe kjo u b� shkaku kryesor p�r humbjen n� zgjedhjet presidenciale t� vitit 1992. \n \nSipas George Tames, presidenti Bush ishte i ngjash�m me presidentin Truman; t� dy pat�n impakte t� ngjashme n� mjediset e tyre presidenciale e personale. \n \nT� dy e konsideronin Sht�pin� e Bardh� si sht�pi, me stafin dhe shtypin si an�tar� t� nj� familjeje t� madhe q� p�rfshinte gjith� kombin. \n \nP�r fotograf�t puna me Trumanin dhe Bushin ishin g�zim. Bushi nuk kishte probleme vizuale. Madje edhe kur reporter�t e pashpirt e cinik� e gjenin n� nj� gjendje t� v�shtir� p�r t� qen� objektiv i problemmeve t� Sht�pis� s� Bardh�, ai i th�rriste ata me emrin e par� dhe i pyeste p�r familjet tyre. Ai ishte shum� miq�sor me shumic�n e fotograf�ve por, m� e r�nd�sishmja, ai ishte edhe i vet�dijsh�m p�r gjith� pun�n e tyre fisnike. Ai komplimentonte fotograf� t� ve�ant� edhe p�r fotot e tyre t� bukura q� nuk kishin lidhje me politik�n ose tensioneve n� Sht�pin� e Bardh�. �Un� e konsideroja at� si nj� stil natyral, q� pasqyronte faktin q� ai ishte i lir� t� ishte q�nja e tij pas tet� vitesh njoll� t� presidentit Regan� P�rshtypjet e mia paraprake ishin se ai do t� ishte nj� president i mir� p�r kohrat dhe se kishte potencial p�r madh�shti. Me zvog�limin e tensioneve t� Luft�s s� Ftoht� vjen nj� mund�si e rrall� p�r t� b�r� p�rshtypje t� gjat� dhe nj� shenj� p�r paqeje�. \n \nGjat� drek�s vjetore p�r nder t� tij presidenti Bush theksonte se ai po iu referohej fotograf�ve me �epitetin� si �Photo Dogs� pasi ai kishte d�gjuar protest�n e humorit me lehje qensh t� fotograf�ve prapa litar�ve, gjat� foto-ops-eve n� Rose Garden. Shum� her� kishte ndodhur q� l�vizjet e mediave t� kufizoheshin, apo ndaloheshin gjoja p�r arsye sigurie apo turmash. Bushi b�ri t� kund�rt�n duke qen� shum� i hapur e i drejtp�rdrejt� jo vet�m me mediat e fotograf�t, por edhe me njer�zit e thjesht� n� rrug�, dyqane, peshkim, sh�titje� \n \nGjat� gjith� jet�s s� tij politike presidenti Bush besonte n� kontaktet personale. Ai ka qen� nj� shkrues lakmitar e prodhimtar sh�nimesh. N�se, ashtu t� shkruara, ato do t� mbeten trash�gimi e vyer personale e komb�tare, k�shtu mund t� konsiderohet edhe nj� prej tyre q� i drejtohej George Tames: \n \n�George Tames, \n \nMe admirim p�r profesionalizmin tuaj dhe vler�simin p�r mir�sjelljen e v�rtet�. Patshi fat, George Bush�. \n \nFotot e realizuara nga George Tames p�r presidentin Bush sh�nojn� p�rfundimin zyrtar t� karier�s s� tij profesionale dhe jan� b�r� n�n trysnin� e nj� �privimi� dhe censure t� rrept� proceduriale, p�r arsye t� siguris� fizike dhe rrethanave politike t� koh�s. \n \nDhjetra ballina t� revist�s �The New York Times� dhe revista e organe t� tjera mbajn� firm�n e George Tames. \n \nDhe k�shtu, pas nj� pune t� gjat� e intensive, por edhe shum� produktive e gjurm�l�n�se, n� vitin 1986, George Tames, zyrtarisht, del n� pension. Dekada t� t�ra pune gjeneroze, pasionante, p�rkushtuese, protagonizmi profesional, inovativ, artistik, q� do t�i linin kapitujve t� historis� politike t� Capitol Hill dhe Sht�pis� s� Bardh�, por edhe asaj bot�rore d�shmi autentike t� panum�rta pamore t� 10 gjeneratave presidenciale rresht, p�rmbylleshin nga ligjet natyrale t� jet�s humane, t� cilat edhe aq ishin treguar shum� bujare ndaj soliditetit e energjive t� tij fizike e shpirt�rore. Kjo ngjarje u shoq�rua me aktivitete t� panumurta festive, takimesh e celebrimesh zyrtare e private, n� shenj� vler�simi e mir�njohjeje ndaj kontributit t� tij t� gjat� n� fotogazetarin� kontemporane amerikane. N� k�to tubime p�rsh�ndet�se ishte s�rish karakteri i zhd�rvjell�t, shpirti i tij human i rip�rt�rir�, stoik, �ilt�rsia dhe humori i tij origjinal, aft�sia p�r t� krijuar situata t� ngrohta e plot humor me dhjetra e dhjetra koleg�, miq e politikan� t� lart�, epiqendra e krijimit t� nj� atmosfere t� paharrueshme miq�sore, q� u pasqyruan gjer�sisht n� shtypin e koh�s dhe kujtohen edhe sot me nostalgji si nj� model i tipareve t� tij njer�zore. \n \nPor edhe pas daljes n� pension, ai nuk heshti. Ai vijoi t� punoj� si fotograf i lir�, kryesisht p�r revist�n �Times�95), si dhe kudo ku e th�rrisnin dhe e ftonin, qoft� edhe p�r pasionin e jet�s s� tij. Edhe nga kjo koh� ai ka l�n� shum� foto emocionuese t� karakterit privat e familiar, ve�an�risht me miqt� e familiar�t e vet. N� pinakotek�n e tij zen� vend edhe shum� foto objektesh e permendoresh monumentale, artist�sh, shkenc�tar�sh, sportist�sh, si dhe shum� peizazhe, natyra t� qeta, fotografi familjare, intime lirike, etj. \n \nAi kishte nj� konstrukt vibrues dhe gjithmon� k�rkonte t� ish n� l�vizje n�p�r qytetin q� ai e dashuronte. Ai ishte nj� rr�fimtar i palodhur, duke treguar anekdoda ai i p�rcillte ato me zem�rgjer�si, duke i mbuluar me nj� qeshje t� thell�. Ai ishte nj� pjes� e atij karakteri t� kultivuar q� e b�ri at� popullor jo vet�m me politikan�t, por edhe me koleg�t e vet. Shakat� dhe qyfyret q� ai tregonte p�r president�t, sidoqoft�, synonin t� konfirmonin vizionin popullor t� �do presidenti me mendjempreht�si. \n \nAi ishte shpirti dhe jeta e nj� feste. �Ai ishte kampioni�� thosh Cornell Capa, ish fotograf i revist�s �Life�. �Ai i �mposhtte� t� gjith�� (From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 1994) \n \nGeorge ishte nj� njeri interesant kur e shihje dhe kur e d�gjoje. Me siguri duhej ta d�gjonit sepse ai e zinte dashin p�r brir�sh. Ai kishte nj� ego dhe sy artisti p�r ta mundur at�. \n \n�George ish ndryshe�, thosh Jim Mones, drejtor i fotoarkiv�s s� New York Times. �Ai ishte nj� shakaxhi, i madh n� thashetheme, n� tregimin e historive, nj� qeshje e madhe. Ai mund t� b�hej gjall�ria e nj� takimi dhe u miq�sua me senator�t q� u b�n� president�. Ata t� gjith� e njihnin dhe e deshin at�, dhe George ishte i aft� t� miq�sohej fort me njer�zit, politikan�t, ve�an�risht me president�t.� \n \nGeorge Tames do t� ishte sot 100 vjet. Veprimtaria jashtzakonisht e madhe, e gjer� cil�sore n� fush�n fotografike t� Kapitol Hill dhe Sht�pis� s� Bardh� e vendos at� midis elites t� historian�ve viziv� e artist�ve t� fotografis� bot�rore, pasi ajo konsiderohet si historia n� fotografi e nj� gjys�m shekulli. \n \nAi botoi n� disa gazeta e revista, por shumica e tyre i takon gazet�s �The New York Times� dhe suplementit t� saj �Sunday Magazine�. Ato q� nuk jan� botuar ndodhen n� arkivin e madh �Lively Morgue� (Morgu i Gjall�), i cili �sht� hapur dhe po promovon n� internet fotot e panjohura t� George Tames. \n \n�Si gjith� fotograf�t e rradh�s s� par�, George kishte syrin e nj� artisti dhe reflekset e nj� sportisti�, ai ishte i aft� t� fiksonte ndjesin� e nj� ngjarjeje dhe jo vet�m identitetin e subjekteve t� tij.�(Howell Raines � shkrimtar). �Tames e pranonte q� ai pati sukses n� gazet�n p�r t� cil�n punonte. Duke e konsideruar veten si �anije akullthyese� me pesh�n e The New York Times-it prapa tij, ai l�vizte n�p�r Capitol si nj� pjes�marr�s aktiv n� procesin politik. \n \nNj� pjes� e fotove t� tij ndodhen n� muzeume, biblioteka presidenciale, institucione e fototeka t� shumta. Me fotot e tij jan� hapur gjithashtu dhjetra ekspozita brenda dhe jasht� SHBA, midis t� cilave e fundit �sht� �elur n� Shqip�ri n� vitin 2015. Ai, gjithashtu ka fituar shum� �mime presidenciale, organesh e shoqatash mediatike, artistike,etj., si dhe vler�sime e dedikime kritike, profesionale e artistike t� panum�rta, por t� merituara t� cilat i q�ndrojn� si nj� brerore rrezatimi human, q� do ta mbajn� ndezur kujtimin e jet�s dhe vepr�s s� tij. \n \nVet� George Tames mbetet nj� foto e gjall� kujtimi e vepr�s s� tij d�shmitare e rikrijuese, q� do t� p�rcillet e do t� admirohet p�rjet�sisht.

In the Investor Testing section of the Report, the Office summarized some of the key findings from its survey, \"Research on the Market for Investment Advice.\"3 These findings, which are summarized below, should help inform the Commission's consideration of proposed Regulation Best Interest:Most investors do not currently receive financial advice regarding their assets. Consumers were asked whether they are currently consulting a financial professional regarding their investment strategies, the type of account to open, or specific financial investments. The aim of these questions was to determine the percentage of investors that receive financial advice from professionals. Only 38.7% of consumers responded \"yes\" to one or more of these questions. This research shows that the majority of investment decisions are not informed by professional advice. The cost associated with finding and screening an investment professional was among the leading reasons that investors cited for not seeking professional advice. The finding that the majority of investment decisions are not professionally informed may be a cause of concern for regulators.Most consumers of investment advice turn to \"dual-hatted\" professionals. The majority of financial advice consumers receive is delivered by a dual registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. Only 3.8% of advice seekers work with a professional that is exclusively registered as a broker-dealer. The majority of consumers were unable to identify the correct legal status of their financial professional.The general public does not understand the obligations arising from the requirement to act in the customer's \"best-interest.\" A survey of investor understandings of the term \"best interest\" found that 73% of investors believe that the reference to \"best interest\" requires financial professionals to help them choose the lowest cost product; all else being equal, 6.1% thought that it required professionals to avoid taking higher compensation for selling one product when similar but less costly products are available, and 86% thought that it required professionals to monitor their account on an ongoing basis. However, the proposed best interest standard applies to broker-dealers who are generally not required to actively monitor accounts as part of their service offerings. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the best interest standard would require professionals to choose the lowest cost product. Originally published in REVERSEinquiries, Volume 2, Issue 1[1].

It seems like so long ago. The fifth season debut of The Walking Dead, in which Carol leads a zombie army in an assault on Sanctuary, was watched by a staggering 17.29 million people in the United States alone. The show's seventh season bow, 'The Day Will Come When You Won't Be', had the show's second-highest rating, despite the widely-mocked cliffhanger at the end of season six. Fans flocked to their televisions to find out just what beloved survivor Jeffrey Dean Morgan's over-the-top Negan bludgeoned to death with that barbed-wire bat. Since that orgy of skull-crushing violence, however, the ratings have joined the brains and blood of Glenn and Abraham, trickling away into the dust of television's new golden age. See related The Good Place has been renewed for season 4[2] The Good Place season 3 episode 11 review: Chidi Sees The Time-Knife[3] The Good Place season 3 episode 10 review: The Book Of Dougs[4] The Walking Dead, in its ninth season, is suffering from its lowest ratings since the show's derided second season, and quite frankly, it's unfair. It's understandable that viewers, burned by years of sub par writing and dubious character decisions, would lose interest in the long-running post-apocalyptic show, but strangely enough, The Walking Dead might be stronger than it's been since the phenomenal debut event that elevated a niche comic book to national attention, made stars out of a half-dozen character actors, and transformed an entire television network's business model from prestige to geek.The direction of a television show can change on a dime, owing to the power of the so-called showrunner. That's the creative engine behind the scenes who determines just what direction a show is supposed to take and how best to get there. The showrunner is a combination of executive producer, head writer, script editor, manager, casting agent, and network liaison. They have almost unlimited power with a show, reporting in this case to AMC's Chief Creative Officer for the Walking Dead universe. Witness the chaos behind the scenes of TWDseason two. Frank Darabont, tired of clashing with network executives, leaves the show and several actors leave with him. Without Darabont's brilliant pilot movie, The Walking Dead doesn't exist. Enter former The Shield writer Glenn Mazzara, who rights the ship with a steady hand and transforms the show from the cash-strapped talky drama of S2 into something leaner, meaner, and with more action. It's a complete philosophical shift in the program, and without Mazzara, The Walking Dead would have become just another cable drama. Instead, ratings improved, critical opinion improved, and the average viewer numbers doubled the impressive first season. Interestingly enough, Mazzara brings on the people who would be crucial in controlling the show's destiny for the next six seasons and beyond, Scott M. Gimple and Angela Kang, as part of a dramatically overhauled writer's room.  Now, Scott Gimple yields the day-to-day control of The Walking Dead to Angela Kang, who seeks to arrest the juggernaut's ratings slide. However, is it worth it to viewers who have been burned to return to the show? Given that a change in showrunner can drastically alter an entire show, the swap from Gimple to Kang yielded immediate changes. First, given Kang's background and experience as a writer[5], she has put a renewed focus on the show's writing. That yielded immediate results in the episodes as produced. The first three episodes of the show's ninth season were three of the best back-to-back-to-back that The Walking Dead has ever had. Under Kang's hand, the show feels more like a mystery than a soap opera or an action movie, and the writing has shown marked improvement thanks to new writers like Geraldine Inoa and Vivian Tse. Those higher Rotten Tomatoes scores aren't inflated; there's a renewed focus on characters having motivations for things that wasn't always present in previous seasons. Characters speak to one another without feeling the need to over-explain for the audience. Even Daryl Dixon, who hasn't spoken in several seasons and is in dire need of a direction[6], talked to Carol about his desire to live apart from the survivor groups and forge his own path in a scene that worked because of what wasn't said as much as what was said. For the first time in a while, The Walking Dead felt comfortable in leaning on its history, perhaps because the rush of new viewers won't be coming. Aiding the show in its efforts to return to form are a couple of significant time-skips, chopping years off of the process of reunification and degradation between the survivor groups. They came together, for awhile, and then gradually fell apart, as the trip between Hilltop and Alexandria is longer in a post-gasoline society. We didn't get a long discussion of how they were running out of canned goods, or how the gasoline had turned bad in engines, it was simply taken for granted that people would figure that out. Eugene drops a throw-away line talking about turning expired ketchup packets into soup. Bio-diesel features heavily in trade between the communities.  Rick Grimes is gone, and the show might be better for it. Just from the critical consensus, the least acclaimed episode of season nine thus far has been the Scott Gimple-penned 'What Comes After'. Best known as the episode in which Andrew Lincoln says his temporary goodbye to the Walking Dead universe, it's a fitting finale to both the era of Scott Gimple's direct daily involvement in The Walking Dead and to seeing Rick Grimes every week. Grimes will return in a series of spin-off movies involving Gimple, but the mothership now has a new pilot and a new figurehead on the bow. It's not an entirely new cast, but without the Grimes family taking the lead, The Walking Dead is free to be a different show, and will be free to reinvent the source material to fit the current cast. Rather than being guided by the Ricktatorship, every community has its own needs, its own wants, and its own motivations. No one's forcing the Saviors to integrate, or trying to save Sanctuary as the community fails due to a lack of farmland. If the Oceanside community is still hunting down Saviors at this point, no one's going to stop them so long as they stay away from the few Saviors that have been rehabilitated by Hilltop or Alexandria. If Michonne wants to not go to the fair, no one's around to make her cooperate with the Kingdom's urge to have a community fair. If Maggie wants to run off with the traveling circus and abandon her community to the leadership of others, there's no guiding hand to rein her back in. There's an unpredictability to The Walking Dead now. There are impressive new villains in the form of The Whisperers, who made a splashy introduction in episode 8. The surviving characters are in deep trouble, trapped in one of the creepiest set pieces the show's done in years. The enemies can blend in with the zombie hordes that shadow characters wherever they go. Neglected characters like Daryl, Carol, and Michonne can take more active leadership roles, while allowing underdeveloped characters like Ben and Aaron to take up important plot positions.  The Walking Dead isn't a new show, but perhaps it is a show in the first stages of rebirth. Season nine has featured a significant changing of the guard in behind the camera, and a passing of the torch in front of the camera. The show's commitment to visual storytelling remains, and the script quality has shown significant improvement. It's a new start, without scrapping the entire show and starting over. That doesn't typically go over well, even when it's needed. The Walking Dead has refreshed, without losing what brought about the initial attraction to the show. It's about civilization versus anarchy, the living versus the dead, working together to survive rather than squabbling over the dwindling remains of the old world. Rather than mourning over what's been taken away from the show, Angela Kang and company are pulling a Hilltop and building on what works and improving on what hasn't. There is still awesome zombie killing action, but at the moment, The Walking Dead seems more like Game Of Thrones with non-frozen undead, a political drama punctuated by graphic violence and supernatural monsters. There's as much politics as there is bloodshed, and if that sounds like an interesting twist to the known Walking Dead universe, then consider trying The Walking Dead on for size once more. Like a well-sewn zombie skin suit, it might just fit. The Walking Dead season 9B arrives on FOX UK on Monday the 11th of February at 9pm.

almost fifty years of the day before the official launching of his pioneering Workingmen�s Association on 2nd March 1936. \n \n Less than three weeks after Mc Intosh�s birth, on the 26th of March 1886, there was born in Union Island and the Grenadines, Hugh Mulzac whose life story in effect offers a capsuled edition on an interest period in Black History. Mulzac has been able to reveal much of the underside of that movement. He sailed on one of the boats of the Black Star Line that was in reality a flagship for political propaganda. \n \n From Mulzac, we learn of the plight of our Black Folk in Panama, and get a vivid picture of charisma at work in Garvey that eventually led to dashed hopes and shattered dreams: \"For a few brief years, Marcus Garvey fired the torch that lighted the Negro night, bringing dreams of glory and equality. Just as quickly the torch flickered and was out, leaving us in darkness as before; poorer, sadder and, perhaps wiser, despite a deep loss of faith in our own capacities�. \n \n Mulzac had the signal honour of being the first Black Man to gain a Master�s Licence, and captained an American ship during the War Years. With the return of peace, however, Hugh Mulzac found himself cast out, at sea, like bilge water. In the psyche of official America any thin Black was Red! And Mulzac had not only identified with militant maritime trade unionism, but also moved and had his being in such Black organisation as the N.A.A.C.P, the National Negro Congress, the Council of African Affairs and the Council of West Indies Federation. Finally he enlisted in the American Labour Party. \n \n Mulzac�s condemnation of the historical anti-communists Mc Carthyism that drained America in the 1950s, was to have a prophetic ring. \"In  short, these activities have to be  seen for what they are, attempts to suppress independent political thinking, compel conformity and to mobilise the people of America, to support the adventures of a war-minded group of leaders who in their desperation can think of no way out of their dilemma but nuclear war to annihilate all mankind.� \n \nEvery dissenter from this national goal was to be labelled \"Communist�. \n After being successfully engaged in long tedious court battles to clear his name and obtain a certificate of political seaworthiness, Mulzac left his adopted home somewhat disillusioned but still determined a fighter. \n\nA Personal Touch \nI met Captain Mulzac in the mid 1960s when he returned to St Vincent in the evening of his days. I was then Extra-Mural Resident Tutor. We warmed towards each other, and got along like house on fire. \n \n Captain Mulzac gave two public talks sponsored by the Department of Extra-Mural Studies, as well as conducted a well-attended course of lectures on general seamanship. His legs might have been a little unsteady then, and his frame somewhat bent, but he had lost nothing of that sense of struggle which had dominated his earlier life, nor the fire in his voice or flashes of the eyes which leapt at you and held  you firmly as he recounted his fight during the stormy days of yore. His mind remained razor-sharp, his thinking crystal clear. \n \nDuring this period, Captain Mulzac launched on the local market his book: A Star to Steer By�, which should be compulsory reading in all schools. He and his publishers graciously gave permission to a group of us to reprint in special issue of our Magazine \"Flambeau� the first chapter of this autobiography, which deals with the near idyllic life of the middle-class youth growing up in Union Island at the turn of the century. One of my treasured possessions is a copy of this publication personally autographed by the maestro himself. \n \nWhen in his later years, he was down and out in the USA owing to persistent racial prejudice and political discrimination, our hero took to painting in \"primitive� style as a sort of therapy for his unending frustrations. He had originally intended to present to the local chapter of the University two of the fruits of these efforts in which he had made heavy emotional investment but, with no home in which to hang them at the time, we settled for the gift to be handed over to the Public Library. \n \nYet, as was the case then with many of his spiritual heirs and kindred spirit, Hugh Mulzac was in the 1960�s marked and watched in Colonial St Vincent. His name probably lingered on some official list, somewhat. On one occasion, his daughter, who runs a bookshop in Guyana, paid him a visit in the company of a \"friend� who turned out to be Janet Jagan. Everywhere they went, their security people were sure to go! \n \n To the end of his days, however, Captain Hugh Mulzac remained a fiercely proud and brave warrior in the cause of human freedom.  He was himself a shining example and living embodiment of that message to future generations that concluded his book. \"Fight for the liberation of oppressed people everywhere, fight for the fullest appreciation of every human need, for fighting the good life for all people, is the only way to live and win it for yourself. Thus does life become worth living�. \n It is the fitting epitaph to this great Vincentian patriot.     \n submit your comments

2018 steel output falls 0.3% on year to 104.33 million mt","content":"Japan�s crude steel production in 2018 decreased by 0.3% year on year to 104.33 million mt, according to the data released Wednesday by the Japan Iron & Steel Federation. \n \nA JISF official said Thursday that steel demand has been firm but natural disasters in the second half of 2018 including torrential rain in western Japan during July, Typhoon Jebi in September and the earthquake in Hokkaido also in September, all affected production. He said the facility problems at the mills late last year also forced the overall production to be lower. \n \n�The production during 2018 fiscal year (April 2018-March 2019) may become higher,� the JISF official said. Production by converters in 2018 was 78.23 million mt, down 1.4% year on year while those by electric arc furnace was 26.1 million mt, up 3.1% year on year.

Immigration Pilot to help bring new skilled worker immigrants to smaller communities.The five-year federal immigration pilot is designed to boost smaller communities with aging populations and labour shortages, which struggle to attract and retain new immigrants.It is intended to build on the growing success of the Atlantic Immigration Pilot[1], an initiative aimed at establishing more young, skilled immigrants in the four Atlantic provinces.The Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot will be open to all other Canadian provinces outside the Atlantic region, excluding Quebec, which manages its own economic immigration programs.To read this article in its entirety please click here[2]Interested employers: Kindly contact us here[3] to receive further information.Interested candidates: Find

Physician Burnout Initiative to Research 1 Million Physician Shift Hours in 2019","content":"Jan 25, 2019( HIT Consultant: http://www.hitconsultant.net Delivered by Newstex)  Pathology of Burnout Initiative led by Lightning Bolt aims to understand patterns in physician work schedules and burnout.  Lightning Bolt Solutions,[1] a provider of optimized physician shift technology announced they will work to identify the root cause of physician burnout by studying one million physician shift hours in 2019. The 'Pathology of Burnout Initiative[2]' starts with the simple act of asking physicians how they are doing. The data from this study will be key in determining how healthcare organizations can make medicine safer.Understanding the Pathology of Physician BurnoutIn the U.S., one doctor commits suicide every day � the highest suicide rate of any profession. Research has shown that physician burnout is also strongly correlated with medical errors, high turnover, and reduced health system performance. This deadly, damaging crisis demands an epidemiologic approach. While there have been studies on burnout, there still is not much insight into how to prevent and resolve the issue.The Research ChallengeAvailable to Lightning Bolt clients via the company's mobile app, physicians checking their work schedule have the opportunity to anonymously answer a single-question survey about their overall wellness and symptoms of burnout. With a full rollout of the wellness survey at the start of the year, the company is taking a major step toward understanding the crisis of physician dissatisfaction in this country.  As part of the Pathology of Burnout Initiative, Lightning Bolt is also providing a place for physicians to privately submit their own personal stories of burnout with the intent of learning more about a crisis that many suffer in silence. For physicians who self-report symptoms of high burnout, Lightning Bolt is providing access to a resource page intentionally curated by physicians for physicians.'We are focusing on 'burning in' to the deadly, damaging crisis of physician burnout with an epidemiological approach,' said Suvas Vajracharya, Ph.D., founder, and CEO of Lightning Bolt Solutions. 'Our goal for this research is to shape how healthcare organizations build more balanced workplaces for physicians, helping to make medicine safer for everyone.'

This time around, the focus is firmly on the now iconic Ikari trilogy. \n \nOriginally released on Nintendo Switch late last year , SNK 40th Anniversary Collection is a celebration of titles released in the early days of hefty SNK�s career which has now spanned four decades. However, during that time we were introduced to a pair of no-nonsense commandos named Ralf and Clark through the Ikari trilogy who later went on to appear in the ever popular King of Fighters and Metal Slug franchises. \n \nOriginally released in 1986, Akari Warriors was an intense top-down shooter. Its run-and-gun gameplay made it a title that�s still fondly remembered more than 30 years later. The sequel, Victory Road , saw the duo take on waves of aliens while brandishing an array of crazy weaponry. Finally, Ikari III: The Rescue hit arcades in the late 1980s featuring vastly improved graphics to its predecessors. While other games in the series were heavily firearm orientated, the third installment concentrated more on hand-to-hand combat. \n \nAll three Ikari games are due to appear as part of SNK 40th Anniversary Collection�s  torrent of retro titles alongside classics such as Athena  and Crystalis . Not only that, but each game in the action-filled trilogy will be presented in both their arcade and home console ports. \n \nSNK 40th Anniversary Collection is scheduled to land on PlayStation 4 on March 22, 2019. \n \n\n \nThe post Ikari Trilogy Brings Top-Down Mayhem to SNK 40th Anniversary Collection by Eoghan Murphy appeared first on DualShockers

Steam","content":"It looks like Capcom�s newly released remake of  Resident Evil 2  is doing quite well on Steam compared to the series� previous entry,  Resident Evil VII: Biohazard.  A Resetera user noticed that at 1:00 a.m. the game had a concurrent player count of around 54,000, and according to the game�s Steam stats right now , it reached a peak of 55,164. For some perspective,  Resident Evil VII: Biohazard  reached a maximum peak of just over 18,000 according to Steam Charts . I guess you really can�t beat the classics. \n \nFor the time being,  Monster Hunter: World  still stands tall as Capcom�s most successful PC title to date. The game�s player count peaked at just under 330,000 when the game launched in August of 2018. If you�re still hammering away at World , you can expect a new expansion sometime later this year. No matter what game�s on top though, successful PC ports means Capcom will more than certainly bring more of their titles to the platform in the future; everybody wins. \n \nIn other  Resident Evil 2  news, Capcom released a very 90s-style live-action trailer for  Resident Evil 2. Additionally, players can expect some sweet post-launch content in the form of retro costumes for both Leon and Claire, as well as a new mode. We recently released our review for  Resident Evil 2,  giving it a remarkable 9 out of 10. Definitely check that out if you�re interested in picking up the game up for yourself. \n \nResident Evil 2  is available now on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. \n \nThe post Resident Evil 2 Has Second Highest Concurrent Player Count of Any Capcom Game on Steam by Jordan Boyd appeared first on DualShockers .","tags":["News","Originals","PC","Platforms","Capcom","Resident Evil 2","steam"],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:00:53Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:49Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:00:53Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721972&p=4s5&v=1&x=NvuchKmKdlrMwpe4VeKkzQ","commentsUrl":"https://www.dualshockers.com/resident-evil-2-remake-steam-success/#respond","outboundUrls":["https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-2-is-now-2nd-top-steam-peak-concurrent-players-game-in-capcom-history-and-top-5-jpn-in-history-55k-now-more-than-triple-re7-numbers.95625/","https://store.steampowered.com/stats/Steam-Game-and-Player-Statistics","https://steamcharts.com/app/418370","https://steamcharts.com/app/582010"],"wordCount":"264","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721972","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Resident-Evil-2-Key-Art-1024x682.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Claire"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Claire"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.978"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Jordan Boyd"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Jordan Boyd"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.975"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"Capcom"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Capcom"},{"name":"instances","value":"6"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.999"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Jonathan Trott"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Leon"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.623"}],"provider":"3"}]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.5164425","entities":[{"type":"Product","value":"Resident Evil 2","mentions":"7","score":"1.69187","evidence":"7","confident":true},{"type":"Product","value":"Steam","mentions":"3","score":"1.26675","evidence":"6","confident":true},{"type":"Company","value":"Steam Charts","mentions":"1","score":"0.624779","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Leon","mentions":"1","score":"1.80229","evidence":"4","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Claire","mentions":"1","score":"1.80229","evidence":"4","confident":true},{"type":"Product","value":"Xbox One","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Jordan Boyd","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true}]},"author":{"name":"Jordan Boyd","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"DualShockers","homeUrl":"https://www.dualshockers.com","location":{"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America"},"metrics":{},"feed":{"id":"102284405","name":"DualShockers","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"WordPress","generator":"https://wordpress.org/?v=5.0.3","description":"Anything and Everything Gaming.","tags":[],"language":"English","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"autoRank":"4","autoRankOrder":"16776","inboundLinkCount":"99"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":["ugc arts feeds"]}}},{"sequenceId":"915940760500","id":"38350721973","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"Metroid Prime 4 is Rebooting Development, Retro Studios in Charge","content":"Metroid Prime 4 has been rebooted and Retro Studios is now in charge of the project.

It seems that Metroid Prime 4 was not meeting internal standards and Nintendo made the difficult decision to reboot the entire project. It will be quite some time until we hear an update on the game again. \n \nTakahashi said �It will be a long road until the next time we will be able to update you on the development progress, and development time will be extensive.� \n \nMetroid series producer Kensuke Tanabe will still be working on the project, but now Retro Studios will be helming the project.

At the time, Retro Studios was not involved at all in the creation of Metroid Prime 4 . Nintendo has been mostly mum on the entire project since then with sparse quotes from Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aim�.

U Deluxe Review � Not Quite New, But Still Pretty Fresh","content":"When it first released back in 2012,  New Super Mario Bros. U has a good amount riding on its shoulders by debuting alongside the Wii U, let alone being one of the first modern  Mario games to officially enter the HD era. Though  New Super Mario Bros. U �s achievements might have been undercut by the underwhelming performance of the Wii U in the years since its release, the arrival of the Nintendo Switch has given the chance for the Wii U�s roster of games to get a second life on a new platform. Joining other titles like  the Bayonetta series ,  Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker ,  Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze ,  Hyrule Warriors , and more, the Switch release of  New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe gives this excellent platformer a new chance to shine, even if it doesn�t feel quite as �new� as it once did in 2012. \n \nFor those that may not have played  New Super Mario Bros. U when it first released, or its  New Super Luigi U expansion  that released in �The Year of Luigi,�  New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe packs both titles into one release for the Nintendo Switch. After Switch owners last saw the series reach new heights with  Super Mario Odyssey in 2017 ,   New NSMBU Deluxe brings things back to the traditional 2D perspective of  Mario games of the past, and while it might lack some of the invigoration that  Odyssey provided from everyone�s favorite plumber,  Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe  still manages to pack in a number of creative and challenging levels. \n \n\n \n\n�The Switch release of  New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe gives this excellent platformer a new chance to shine, even if it doesn�t feel quite as �new� as it once did in 2012.� \n \n \nAs an experience that is closer to some of the series� classics like  Super Mario World , N SMBU Deluxe is both a return to the 2D platforming that Mario fans know and love, but with enough tweaks and new mechanics implemented to give a slightly higher dose of challenge, especially in  New Super Luigi U . Outside of just running and jumping, players can also perform a few more acrobatic feats, such as wall jumping and a new spin maneuver that can give that slight extra bit of momentum to nail a landing, or to enhance Mario�s power-ups like fire flowers and ice flowers. \n \nEven more impressive in  NSMBU Deluxe are the range of power-ups and abilities that players have at their disposal, including the flying squirrel suit that lets Mario glide across stages, the penguin suit that lets you slide across ice at breakneck speed, and the Switch version�s brand new Super Crown item that specifically allows Toadette to transform into Peachette with her own set of abilities. Much to the internet�s dismay, Bowsette doesn�t make an appearance , so don�t get your hopes up. \n \n\n \n\n�Even more impressive in  NSMBU Deluxe are the range of power-ups and abilities that players have at their disposal, including the flying squirrel suit that lets Mario glide across stages, and more.� \n \n \nOutside of the new and varied ways that players can move through each level in  NSMBU Deluxe , the real joy of the game comes through the fact that even more than in its original release, the game�s platforming feels right at home on the Nintendo Switch either on your TV or while playing on the go. Given the bite-sized nature of each level�the majority of which take less than five minutes to complete� NSMBU Deluxe offers just the right amount of challenge and excitement if you�re looking to sneak in a few levels during your commute or lunch break, while also delivering a colorful, joyful experience if you�re looking to play at home. \n \nEven better is the fact that the game�s co-op play is an incredible fit for the Switch, making it easy to play a full-fledged 2D  Mario  game anywhere at anytime. Though the frantic action of four-player co-op might be better-suited to playing on a TV versus sitting around a Switch in tabletop mode, having the ability to break off the Joy-Con and play with a friend on the go seems just like the way that  NSMBU Deluxe was always intended to be played. While the game does offer a fair amount of challenge compared to most other  Mario  titles,  NSMBU Deluxe does remedy this a bit for younger/less experienced players with the additions of Nabbit and Toadette, who each have some abilities to give players a bit of an easier time in the game. \n \n\n \n\n�The game�s co-op play is an incredible fit for the Switch, making it easy to play a full-fledged 2D  Mario  game anywhere at anytime.� \n \n \nWith a solid foundation of mechanics and 2D platforming that has been refined better than ever before, the only elements that I really came away with mixed feelings from playing  NSMBU Deluxe are the game�s visuals and level design. As much as NSMBU   showed the possibilities of what an HD-era  Mario  game could look like with the launch of the Wii U, the same can�t quite be said for the game�s appearance on Switch with more capable hardware. \n \nFrom a performance standpoint,  NSMBU Deluxe plays tremendously fast and fluid even when four players are onscreen at once. But from a visual standpoint, the themes and designs of the levels don�t stray too far from what we�ve seen before from past  Mario  games; you can still expect, ice, water, and fire-themed levels much like we�ve seen before, with only a couple levels really standing out in significant ways, such as the lush visuals of the Painted Swampland, or some of the post-game levels that will really test your dexterity and reflexes. \n \n\n \n\n�Filled with well over 150 levels between the base game and the  New Super Luigi U expansion, there�s more than enough in  NSMBU Deluxe to keep players occupied on-the-go or surrounding a big-screen TV.� \n \n \nWhile the expectations for a  Mario game have been raised in a post- Super Mario Odyssey world, that shouldn�t drive you away from experiencing one of the Wii U�s earliest hits with  New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe . Filled with well over 150 levels between the base game and the  New Super Luigi U expansion, there�s more than enough in  NSMBU Deluxe to keep players occupied on-the-go or surrounding a big-screen TV, and the game�s tremendously fun co-op multiplayer is right at home on the Switch. Though it may not shine as brightly as it did six years ago, there�s no denying that New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe is still a gem in its own right. \n \nThe post New Super Mario Bros.

(January 22, 2019) - To prevail in a premises liability action in Illinois, a plaintiff must prove the following:The existence of a condition that presents an unreasonable risk of harm to persons on the premises;That the defendants knew or should have known that the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm;That the defendants should have anticipated that individuals on the premises would fail to discover or recognize the danger or otherwise fail to protect themselves against it;A negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant;An injury suffered by the plaintiff; andThat the condition on the property was a proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff.The second element is known as the \"notice\" requirement. In Illinois, a defendant must either have actual or constructive notice that a condition existed that posed an unreasonable risk of harm to others.In the recent caseStimac v. JC Penney Corp., No. 16 CV 03581(10/10/18), the plaintiff, Stimac, was walking in the jewelry department of the Joliet JC Penney when she slipped on a \"laminate flyer, laminate piece of paper or piece of paper\" resulting in injury. Stimac then filed suit in District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.Stimac claimed that she did not need to establish actual or constructive notice, because it could be inferred from the evidence that it was more likely that an employee of the defendant, rather than a customer, dropped the \"laminate flyer/piece of paper\" and as such was an exception to the notice requirement. SeeDonoho v. O'Connell's, 148 N.E.2d 434 (1958); Reed v. Wal-Mart, 700 N.E.2d 212 (1998).Following fact discovery, the defendant moved for summary judgment. CitingReed, the District Court judge granted JC Penney's motion, finding that while the plaintiff may have established that she slipped on a paper, and that JC Penney displayed advertisements which contained paper resembling the one on which plaintiff slipped, she had not provided sufficient evidence that JC Penney or its employees, as opposed to a customer, caused the flyer to be on the floor.InReed, the court had found that the notice exception applied when a plaintiff: (1) shows that the object is related to the defendant's business; and (2) offers some slight evidence that the defendant or its employees, rather than a customer, placed the object on the floor.In this instance, however, the plaintiff failed to link the flyer to JC Penney as there was no testimony of such a relationship. Further, the court found that a lack of evidence about how long the flyer was on the floor also doomed the plaintiff's alternative claim that JC Penney had constructive notice.Notice is always an issue in premises cases and must be thoroughly analyzed as Illinois courts have ample case law to support summary judgment. Additionally, federal courts tend to dislike personal injury cases; therefore, defendants should look to motion practice as a means of seeking summary disposition.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

They can enforce the right and treat the lease as at an end, or decide not to enforce the right and treat the lease as continuing.However, various acts on the part of the landlord may amount to a waiver of the right to forfeit, including the demand and acceptance of rent. Under the \"old\" law, levying distress waived the right to forfeit, other than in the case of forfeiture for arrears of rent under the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (applicable in very limited circumstances). Because distress could only be exercised while the lease was alive, it waived any forfeiture up to the day of distress.CRAR, by contrast, can be exercised after a lease ends, in the limited circumstances specified in the Act.Background factsA lease of premises at 101 Stanley Road Teddington was granted on 10 July 2013 for a term expiring in May 2034. According to the terms of the lease, rent was payable in equal instalments on the usual quarter days.Although the precise amounts were not agreed, the tenant accepted that it was in arrears of rent during the course of the lease.In January 2016, the landlord instructed enforcement agents to recover the arrears by the exercise of CRAR.On 29 January 2016, the tenant paid a cheque for 3,000 into the landlord's bank account.On 1 February 2016, enforcement agents instructed by the landlord exercised CRAR for stated rent arrears of 8,270. With fees, the total was 10,533.20, which amount the tenant paid to the enforcement agents on 4 February 2016.Believing that he had cleared all the arrears of rent when he paid the enforcement agents, the tenant subsequently cancelled the cheque for 3,000 which he had paid into the landlord's bank account. The cheque was dishonoured and the landlord contended that the amount sought by the enforcement agents was reduced by the same amount.The landlord purportedly forfeited the lease by peaceable re-entry on 12 February 2016.Summary judgmentThe question whether the landlord's purported forfeiture was lawful was determined as a preliminary issue. At first instance, His Honour Judge Madge decided that the landlord's action was unlawful, essentially because, under the \"old\" law, the landlord's conduct would have amounted to an election to treat the lease as continuing. The last rent payment before the forfeiture was 25 December 2015 and the next rent payment was not due until 25 March 2016. At the time of the purported forfeiture on 12 February 2016, there were no arrears supporting the landlord's re-entry of the premises, which was therefore unlawful. The judge concluded that, because CRAR effectively replaced distress for rent, the same principle applied.The appealOn appeal it was held that the judge had been wrong to assume that the exercise of CRAR amounted to waiver just because that had been the effect of distress. Material differences between the old and new regimes meant that CRAR was not the equivalent of distress for rent. The law of waiver and election, however, continued to be governed by the common law.The landlord argued that the exercise of CRAR could not be an unequivocal recognition of the continuation of a lease because there were circumstances in which it could be exercised after the end of a lease.The appeal judge dismissed the landlord's arguments based on a consideration of the facts of the case. The lease was not at an end on 1 February, when CRAR was exercised and, in addition, the statutory conditions which permit the exercise of CRAR after the end of a lease were not met. CRAR could therefore only be exercised while the lease continued. In the circumstances, the landlord's exercise of CRAR was an unequivocal communication that the lease was continuing.The landlord's other grounds of appeal were also dismissed.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - January 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Probably everyone, even if not significantly affected by this accounting standard, remembers at least the most important change: in many cases the lessees will now have to recognize their operating lease on balance sheet which means to record a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability. \"What's so difficult about that?\" you may ask. But this new accounting treatment has several not-so-obvious impacts that reveal themselves along the way... impairment of the ROU assets following IAS 36 is one of them.Does it mean I have to test for an impairment?The ultimate question that comes to mind when we say IFRS 16 and impairment is probably this one: is the newly recognized asset, represented by the ROU asset, tested for impairment? The response is, \"YES!\" (however, with some exemptions). The impairment of ROU assets recognized by a lessee is fairly similar to the accounting for impairment of a leased asset by a lessor in case of operating leases under IAS 17. In general, since the ROU asset is a non-financial asset, the IAS 36 requirements apply.There are only two exemptions from the IAS 36 impairment model. Firstly, when a lessee applies a fair value model under IAS 40 for its investment properties, it shall also apply fair value model to the ROU asset. And secondly, if ROU assets relate to a class of PPE to which the lessee applies the revaluation model under IAS 16, then the lessee can elect to apply the revaluation model to all of the ROU assets that relate to that class of PPE.How does it work in practice?General IAS 36 provisions apply to the lease asset and lease liabilities in the same way as for all other assets under the IAS 36 scope. The ROU asset is tested for impairment on a single standalone basis unless it generates cash inflows only in combination with other assets, together forming a cash-generating unit (CGU). Such an ROU asset will be tested for an impairment as a part of this larger CGU and included in its carrying amount.But what about the lease liabilities: should these be included in the CGU carrying amount and recoverable amount as well? The response ismdash;it depends. The IAS 36.78 provision requires us to consider whether, upon a sale of the CGU, the buyer will also be required to assume the liability, which in our view also encompasses the lessee's lease liability. In such a case the liability, and potentially the lease liability, needs to be included in the recoverable amount of the CGU and by analogy in the carrying amount of CGU as well. The conclusion of whether the buyer is required to assume the lease liability will depend on facts such as a whether the CGU is a legal entity, the lease contract terms, etc.That's enough to digest for now.Watch this space for more not-so-obvious points regarding impairment of leases and the accounting treatment of an impairment for a lessor.Next up on the KPMG Blog: Ten trends driving cyber security in 2019[1]The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The new members expect to get a full years of savings and other advantages that comes with their new membership.  What they don't think about is you only save if you use that new membership on a regular basis.   If you rarely go to the store it will take you forever to recoup the cost of your new membership.  If you have to force yourself to go to the store, the newness of that new membership will wear off quickly.\n     Sam's has two levels of membership.  The basic membership is $45 annually.  The Sam's Plus membership is $100 annually.  For years I had the basic membership but last year I up graded to the Sam's Plus membership.  The Sam's Plus has a few more perks than the basic membership one of them being free shipping on almost everything in the store and Sam's on line inventory.  Since a round trip from my house to Sam's is 52 miles, the free shipping alone pays for my $100 annual fee.\n     So is a Sam's club membership worth it's cost?  In my case it is.  Here's my break down  of savings for 2018.  $86.75 Instant Savings ( extra money off, Sam's product specials every month )\n                $93.93 Cash back check ( for using the Sam's Master Card)\n                $10.00 Cash back ( spending at least $500.00 at Sams in 2018 )\n                $155.00 Gas savings (  A 52 round trip to Sam's take 2.5 gallons of gas.  28 items shipped                                                                                                     instead of having to drive to Sams )\n                $252.00 Free shipping's savings on 28 items ( $9.00 per item )\n                $297.00 The across the board saving at Sam's is 33% At Costco it's 30% At BJ's its 29%.                                I spend around $900.00 annually at Sam's ( 33% of $900.00 = $297.00\n     My Sam's saving total for 2018 was $894.68.  Not bad for spending $100.00 for a Sam's annual membership.  If I were buying for an average  family of four instead of just myself, one could multiply the savings several times.

Now the Russian State Duma will have to amend the Media Law in order to clarify the relevant provisions and bring them into compliance with the Constitution of Russia.The amendments to article 19.1 of the Media Law came into effect on 1 January 2016. Those amendments further tightened the restrictions for direct and indirect control by foreign persons over Russian legal entities with a broadcasting licence under Russian law. Under the amended Media Law, foreigners were, and still are, not allowed to directly own shares in a Russian mass media/broadcasting entity or control the editorial content of Russian mass media. The Media Law also restricts indirect ownership and control by foreigners to a maximum of 20% of the shares in an entity with shares in a Russian mass media/broadcasting entity. These restrictions also apply to Russian citizens with dual citizenship or, arguably, with a foreign residence permit.The amended Media Law affected printed periodicals, online editions as well as radio and television broadcasters in Russia and was highly criticized by the industry. One of the persons affected was Mr Finkelstein, a participant (shareholder) in Radio-Shans, who was forced to reduce his shareholding in Radio-Shans due to by the amended Media Law. In his complaint to the Constitutional Court Mr Finkelstein claimed that article 19.1 of the Media Law is unconstitutional due to the following:It disproportionally limits the rights of private ownership, to judicial protection and the right to freely transfer, create and distribute information;It is discriminatory to Russian citizens with dual citizenship as compared to Russian citizens with no foreign citizenship; andIt is not sufficiently specific (does not define what investment share in the broadcasting entity is allowed).The Constitutional Court ruled that the provisions of article 19.1 of the Media Law contradict the Constitution of the Russian Federation. In particular it has to be clarified which individuals and legal entities are restricted from owning shares in Russian broadcasting entities (thus, the definition of a participant shall be explained) and how a Russian citizen with dual citizenship, being a shareholder in a Russian mass media outlet (or a broadcasting entity) and owning more than 20% of the shares in such a mass media outlet/broadcaster is allowed to exercise their corporate rights. Furthermore, the decision requires to clarify that foreigners owning shares in Russian mass media outlets/broadcasters shall have recourse to judicial protection in order to protect their property rights and legitimate interests in relation to such mass media outlets/broadcasters.The decision further requires the Russian legislation authorities (i.e. the State Duma and the Council of Federation) to amend the Media Law, taking into account the position of the Constitutional Court. The decision, however, does not set any time limits for the parliament to draft and adopt the relevant amendments. Under article 87 of the Federal Constitutional Law \"On the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation\", should the legislator fail to amend the relevant unconstitutional provision, then such provision can be found to be inoperative, i.e. a court could regard such a provision as not applicable. So far it is also unclear to what extent the parliament would amend the Media Law and what consequences the amended law would have. We will keep monitoring this issue and will let you know of any developments in this respect.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Circuit Sides With FERC; Prevents Full Abandonment","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In 2005, Congress sought to encourage investment in the nation's power grid by requiring the Federal Energy Recovery Commission (FERC) to establish ldquo;incentive-basedrdquo; rate treatments for electric transmission facilities.1[1] Order No. 679,2[2] FERC's transmission incentives rule adopted in 2006, created eight categories of incentive rate treatment for which utilities could apply, including a so-called ldquo;abandonmentrdquo; incentive. An applicant seeking this incentive rate treatment may apply to FERC for approval to recover from ratepayers 100 percent of the prudently incurred costs of transmission facilities that are canceled or abandoned due to factors beyond the utility's control. The idea behind this incentive rate treatment was to facilitate investment by mitigating some of the investment risk in transmission projects, including the state and local permitting process.3[3] San Diego Gas ...ectric Company (SDG...filed a petition for declaratory order with FERC in September 2015 to establish its eligibility for the abandonment incentive for the South Orange County Reliability Enhancement Project, an effort to rebuild and upgrade a substation and to replace and relocate certain transmission and distribution line segments. By the time of the application, the company had already spent roughly $31 million on the project. FERC issued a declaratory order in March 2016 finding that, should the project be abandoned for reasons beyond the company's control, SDG...ould recover 100 percent of the prudently incurred project costs going forward, but that it would not be entitled to recover all of the $31 million that hasalready been spent on the project.4[4] Instead, half of those costs could be recovered from ratepayers in accordance with FERC's pre-Order No. 679 practice. SDG#38;E appealed that decision, arguing that it should be entitled to the abandonment incentive rate treatment for the full cost of the project.The D.C. Circuit sided with FERC[5] in a split decision.5[6] Writing for the majority, Judge Pillard emphasized that the purpose of FERC's incentive program is to encourage investment in needed infrastructure projects. The majority therefore agreed with FERC that the portion of the project that was already financed and paid for before receiving approval for the incentive rate treatment ldquo;lacked the requisite nexus to the facilitation of new investment.rdquo;6[7] In other words, the incentive rate treatment cannot encourage an investment that has already occurred. The company itself had acknowledged that it had incurred the $31 million of costs ldquo;without assurance of cost recovery.rdquo;7[8]In a lengthy dissent, Judge Randolph took issue with, among other things, the majority's characterization of when the ldquo;incentiverdquo; to invest begins. ldquo;The fallacy in [the majority's] theory is its failure to recognize that FERC created the incentive when it promulgated the regulation in 2006,rdquo; Judge Randolph wrote, ldquo;well before San Diego began incurring costs for its transmission project.rdquo; Judge Randolph points out that FERC has rejected a ldquo;but forrdquo; test (i.e., the applicant does not need to show that the investment would not occur but for the incentive rate treatment), and that lack of ldquo;certain recoveryrdquo; prior to a FERC application does not render the incentive treatment meaningless. Indeed, even if an applicant is approved for the rate treatment, the applicant still lacks ldquo;certain recovery,rdquo; since it will later have to make a prudency showing to recover the costs from ratepayers.FERC has granted preorder abandonment incentives before, although not in a case where a party objected to such recovery, as here. As the first case to litigate the precise issue of when the abandonment incentive rate treatment may begin, this decision establishes a precedent that FERC is likely to follow in future cases. FERC has emphasized, however, that each application for transmission incentives will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.Footnotes1[9] Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub. L.

S� entre dezembro do ano passado e janeiro deste ano, o consumo de �gua em Sorocaba aumentou cerca de 40%, uma situa��o que preocupa o Saae. \n \nDe acordo com o diretor-geral da autarquia, Ronald Pereira da Silva, �Sorocaba � uma cidade privilegiada por ter represas com mananciais que conseguem abastecer toda a popula��o. Mas esse � um recurso finito, n�o podemos achar que nunca seremos atingidos, at� porque j� tivemos exemplos anteriores de forte estiagem quando a pr�pria popula��o sofreu muito�, disse. \n \nRonald ressalta ainda que o pedido � para que a popula��o possa utilizar a �gua com consci�ncia, evitando lavar cal�adas e carros � com exce��o dos lava-jatos, que trabalham com essa finalidade e utilizam equipamentos que reduzem a quantidade de �gua utilizada. �N�s sabemos perfeitamente que em alguns casos h� a necessidade desse uso pelo consumidor comum. Mas o que a gente tem que conscientizar � de que n�o d� para gastar achando que tem �gua � vontade�, destaca o diretor-geral da autarquia. \n \nDe acordo com as �ltimas medi��es do Saae sobre o n�vel das represas que abastecem a cidade, Itupararanga (que fica na divisa de Votorantim com outros munic�pios e � respons�vel pelo abastecimento de metade da cidade de Sorocaba) encontrava-se com 43% do n�vel total. A de Ipaneminha, localizada no bairro Ipanema das Pedras, havia perdido 70% e Castelinho com 90%. Em dias de temperatura elevada na cidade, o consumo de �gua aumenta, em m�dia, de 20% a 30%. \n \nAinda segundo o diretor, a preocupa��o � que o aumento no consumo de �gua levam os reservat�rios a operarem com capacidade m�nima, levando a uma queda de press�o nas bombas. �O resultado de tudo isso � que as bombas trabalham com menor pot�ncia e levam menos �gua aos canos. Isso � pr�prio do sistema. Outra quest�o, s�o as partes altas dos bairros que demoram mais para receber essa �gua, infelizmente�, completa. \n \nQualquer desperd�cio de �gua deve ser denunciado ao Saae-Sorocaba, que atende gratuitamente pelo telefone 0800 770 1195 ou pelo e-mail fale@saaesorocaba.sp.gov.br.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:36:22Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T13:36:22Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722372&p=4s5&v=1&x=0p20mHa6ODB_6UfOyMTPGA","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"389","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38348366952","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.jornalipanema.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a994b0be-2009-06-15-represa-de-itupararanga-principal-que-abastece-sorocaba-ft-zaqueu-proenca-202-360.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"Water Consumption","score":"92"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"Consumption","score":"79"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"Water + Wastewater Management","score":"65"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"sentiment":{"score":"-0.10901317","entities":[{"type":"Location","value":"Pereira","mentions":"1","score":"16.2665","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Location","value":"Itupararanga","mentions":"1","score":"1.62471","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Location","value":"divisa de Votorantim","mentions":"1","score":"1.62471","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Location","value":"desperd�cio de �gua","mentions":"1","score":"-12.5912","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Location","value":"Saae","mentions":"1","score":"-2.89856","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Location","value":"Sorocaba","mentions":"1","score":"-2.89856","evidence":"1","confident":true}]},"author":{"name":"Alana Damasceno","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"26652","name":"Jornal Ipanema","homeUrl":"http://www.jornalipanema.com.br","category":"Local","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Brazil","countryCode":"BR","region":"Americas","subregion":"South America"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"3.50","pageAuthority":"35.00","domainAuthority":"34.00","externalLinks":"4007","links":"16926"}},"feed":{"id":"169817197","name":"Jornal Ipanema","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940763571","id":"38350722377","language":"Chinese","languageCode":"zh","title":"moony ??? ?????

yang akan datang berada ditangan anak sekarang. .Semakin baik keperibadian anak sekarang maka semakin baik pula kehidupan masa depan bangsa \n\nMenurut Hurlock (1980), manusia berkembang melalui beberapa tahapan yang berlangsung secara berurutan, terus menerus dan dalam tempo perkembangan yang tertentu, terus menerus dan dalam tempo perkembangan yang tertentu dan biasa berlaku umum. Sebagai seorang anak,kita memiliki peran dan kewajiban kepada orangtua. Ada banyak hal yang menjadi tanggung jawab, tugas atau kewajiban seorang anak kepada orangtua yaitu setiap anak harus menyayangi kedua orangtua yang telah dengan segala daya upaya berjuang membesarkan anak-anaknya agar kelak nanti menjadi orang yang berhasil di dunia dan di akhirat.Patuh terhadap perintah orangtua, orangtua akan sangat senang sekali jika anak-anaknya mau menuruti segala apa yang diinginkan orangtua. Namun yang jelas anak-anak tidak wajib menuruti kemauan orangtuanya yang melanggar ajaran agama dan melanggar hukum. Rajin ibadah dan selalu mendoakannya, menjadi anak yang baik, rajin belajar menimba ilmu, selalu siap membantu orang tua, menjaga nama baik orang tua dan memberi nafkah ketika anak sudah dewasa dan bekerja. Orang tua memiliki peran mendidik anak agar menjadi baik dan berbakti. Peran orang tua disini tidak hanya mendidik saja tetapi mereka juga berperan sebagai panutan anak-anak mereka. Orang tua memberikan contoh kepada anak-anak mereka, tidak hanya itu juga sebagai orang tua harus memberi kenyamanan untuk anak-anaknya mereka berperan juga sebagai teman, sahabat bagi anak-anaknya. \n\nDengan demikian, peran orang tua terhadap anak sangatlah penting. Seorang anak juga berperan penting untuk orang tua. Berbakti dan menyayangi kedua orang tua besar pahala nya dan sudah kewajiban seorang anak. Orang tua yang menginginkan anaknya menjadi anak yang sholih sholihah pun hendaknya berusaha dan berdoa. Sebab jika tidak dibarengi doa akan sia sia. \n\nDitulis Oleh  : Isma Amalia (14) \n\nKelas   : XII MIPA 7","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:58:54Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:58:54Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722384&p=4s5&v=1&x=SXyXouJiPioVTVZS6vc8zQ","outboundUrls":["https://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=acf3ddcf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af820636&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"wordCount":"328","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350722384","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://assets-a1.kompasiana.com/items/album/2019/01/25/14-isma-a-5c4b22f743322f72ed67e959.jpg?t=o&v=1200"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"136682","name":"Kompasiana","homeUrl":"https://www.kompasiana.com","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Indonesia","countryCode":"ID","region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"6.10","pageAuthority":"61.00","domainAuthority":"81.00","externalLinks":"2838191","links":"3326378"}},"feed":{"id":"236029393","name":"Kompasiana","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940764062","id":"38350722386","language":"Indonesian","languageCode":"id","title":"Apa Benar \"Practice\" Menjadikan Kita \"Perfect\" ?","content":"Kalimat diatas mungkin sudah familiar kita temui.

Beras Spesial untuk Sulawesi Selatan","content":"Untuk urusan selera humor, sepertinya Direktur Utama (DIrut) Perusahaan Umum Badan Urusan Logistik (BULog) layak diacungi jempol. Budi -Buwas- Waseso yang memimpin Badan Usaha MIlik Negara ini, memang pandai membuat lelucon, yang mungkin dialamatkan untuk meledek lawannya. \n\nBeberapa hari lalu, Buwas mengutarakan mimpinya bisa mengekspor beras pada masa panen raya di bulan Maret mendatang. Tolok ukurnya adalah, ekspor bakal dilakukan jika gudang beras milik Bulog tak cukup menyerap beras hasil panen raya. \n\nMenurut hitungan kasar sang Direktur Utama Bulog, Budi -Buwas- Waseso, saat ini gudang Bulog sudah terisi 2,1 juta ton beras. Dengan kondisi tersebut, pihaknya hanya mampu menyerap 1,8 juta ton beras dari hasil panen raya. Hanya sebanyak itu, dan tidak bisa menyerap lebih banyak lagi. \n\nAtas dasar itu lah, Buwas berasumsi bisa menjual hasil produksi panen beras petani ke beberapa negara karena mungkin mereka butuh dari Indonesia. Bahkan ia dengan percaya dirinya mengaku sudah melakukan beberapa pembicaraan dengan negara sahabat untuk menjajal wacana ekspor beras. \n\nIa juga menjadikan petani sebagai alasan dari rencana ekspor tadi. Menurutnya ekspor ini juga ditujukan agar harga gabah yang diterima petani tak anjlok. Sebab, sesuai hukum permintaan dan penawaran, lonjakan suplai akan bikin harga beras turun jika permintaan dianggap tetap. \n\nTapi belum sampai seminggu, mimpi itu seperti direvisi oleh Buwas sendiri. Kepada wartawan yang menemuinya di Istana, Jumat siang, BUwas mengaku sedang mengkaji opsi impor beras. Ini jauh bertolak belakang denga keinginannya beberapa hari lalu untuk mengekspor beras. \n\nOpsi impor beras itu, menurut Buwas hanya dikhususkan ke provnisi Sulawesi Selatan. Alasannya, provinsi tersebut sedang terkena musibah banjir, sehingga ada potensi gagal panen yang harusnya terjadi di bulan Februari dan Maret 2019 nanti. \n\nSebelum opsi itu diputuskan, Buwas dan Kementerian teknis (dalam hal ini Kementerian PErtanian dan Kementerian PErdagangan) akan mengkaji terlebih dahulu dampak dari banjir Sulsel. \n\nKekuatiran akan terjadinya gagal panen itu wajar. Karena mengacu pada Data Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB), tercatat setidaknya ada 11.433 hektare sawah yang terendam banjir. \n\nSumber \n  \nKecuali (meme edit pribadi) \n Tapi di luar alasan bencana banjir tadi, wacana opsi impor padi oleh Buwas tadi juga mengandung pesan implisit. Ia seperti ingin menyindir Menteri Pertanian (Mentan) Amran SUlaiman yang berasal dari provinsi tersebut. \nMendatangkan beras impor ke kampung halaman AMran, ibarat menyerang langsung ke jantung pertahanan. Karena selama ini, Mentan Amran Sulaiman kerap menggembar-gemborkan surplus produksi padi dalam negeri. \nAmran juga yang mengajukan impor beras di RApat Koordinasi Terbatas (Rakortas), dan ia juga yang menentang impor itu ketika dicegat wartawan seusai rapat. \n\nKelakuan Buwas menyindir Amran itu mungkin ada hubungannya dengan perlakuan Amran kepada  Buwas terlebih dahulu. \n\nBerbekal data dari Kementerian PErtanian, BUlog yang dipimpin Buwas sempat ikut menolak impor beras. Belakangan, data produksi beras dikoreksi Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS). Untung saja, Buwas tidak pasang badan harga mati mendukung Amran. Karena bila itu terjadi, entah sudah melonjak setinggi apa harga beras di dalam negeri. \n\nBerikutnya, Buwas mungkin juga kesal dengan data produksi jagung dalam negeri versi Kementan. Katanya, produksi jagung kita surplus hingga 13 juta ton. Tapi kenyataan di lapangan, harga jagung tetap tinggi. Bahkan KEmentan sendiri yang mengajukan impor jagung, dan membuat BUlog ketempuan kerja tambahan.  Tidak berhenti sampai di situ, Mentan AMran Sulaiman juga menyalahkan factor logistic sebagai penyebab harga jagung yang mahal di dalam negeri. \n\nUntung saja Buwas masih melancarkan pembalasan yang elegan untuk Arman. Kini ia menyindir bahwa Indonesia memang bisa ekspor beras. Tapi khusus untuk Sulawesi Selatan, kampung halaman Amran, memerlukan bantuan beras dari luar negeri. \n  \nTenggelamkan (meme edit pribadi)","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:52:48Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:52:48Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722390&p=4s5&v=1&x=DsTPEcqL1Y1ZBn61n7FoUg","outboundUrls":["https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20190124193818-92-363639/buwas-buka-opsi-impor-beras-jika-sulsel-gagal-panen","https://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=acf3ddcf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af820636&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"wordCount":"562","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350722390","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://assets-a1.kompasiana.com/items/album/2019/01/25/buwas3-5c4b22ef6ddcae487a2611e2.jpg?t=o&v=1200"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"136682","name":"Kompasiana","homeUrl":"https://www.kompasiana.com","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Indonesia","countryCode":"ID","region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"6.10","pageAuthority":"61.00","domainAuthority":"81.00","externalLinks":"2838191","links":"3326378"}},"feed":{"id":"236029393","name":"Kompasiana","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940764429","id":"38350722371","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"Fort Washington Investment Advisors Inc.

Ingat kelemahan orang yang kelewat disanjung-dipuja adalah bisa lupa dengan kesalahan kesalahan yang ia buat sendiri karena dirinya sendiri bisa ikut tersihir dengan pengkultusan publik terhadap dirinya.jadi yang salah kadang bukan individu yang dikultuskan tetapi publik atau media yang mengkultuskan \n\nCiri pribadi dengan nalar yang sudah terpapar kultus adalah perasaan tak terima apabila sang idola ditempatkan pada posisi sebagai sang terdakwa misal atau dipandang memiliki  noda, bahkan tanpa mau secara obyektif menganalisis kesalahan yang dilakukannya. padahal secara obyektif pandangan pandangan yang dari manapun termasuk yang menyudutkan sang idola mesti di analisis secara seksama.tapi penolakan secara langsung terhadap suara suara yang menyudutkan sang idola banyak terjadi di dunia sosmed utamanya dan menjadi bagian dari perang opini diantara publik yang pro-kontra.disana nalar sudah tak banyak berperan karena posisinya diganti oleh emosi \n\nMaka yang terjadi adalah kesalahannya itu justru lalu dilempar kepada para penuduh lalu para penuduh malah di stigmakan sebagai 'musuh demokrasi' demi agar sang idola dapat dicitrakan sebagai orang tak bersalah dan untuk lalu diberi atribut 'pahlawan demokrasi'.yang biasa melakukan demikian biasanya  adalah media luar tempat darimana konsep demokrasi berasal lalu di ikuti oleh para pencerna nya.sehingga yang terjadi adalah pembalikan serta kekacauan nalar publik.orang sudah tak peduli lagi pada mana serta bagaimana itu benar serta salah karena kepentingan kelompok atau pengkultusan terhadap demokrasi yang kadang dikedepankan \n\nDengan kata lain fakta negatif dari sang idola kadang tertenggelamkan dibawah  bayangan kebesaran imajinatif yang disematkan kepadanya dan malah menanggalkan para penuduh sebagai para antagonis musuh demokrasi. sang idola seolah tak boleh tersentuh penghakiman \n\nSebab itu bila ingin seseorang itu lahir sebagai pemimpin sejati maka biarkan tumbuh kembang secara alami,biarkan Tuhan yang membimbing nya dengan ujian dan cobaan,termasuk bila sang idola melakukan kesalahan maka biarkan ia menanggungnya sendiri,jangan pernah memprotes penghakimannya. biarkan semua apa adanya sesuai fakta, jangan digelembungkan dengan pujian dan pencitraan seperti balon yang di tiup padahal bila meletus ternyata tak berisi apa apa. karena secara psikologis sanjungan itu bukan menghidupkan tetapi malah bisa ber efek mematikan jiwa,termasuk mematikan idealisme dari individu yang disanjung bila ia memiliki idealisme \n\n.....","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:49:42Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:49:42Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722396&p=4s5&v=1&x=uXFx2kdka1DV2cOhUfyHCQ","outboundUrls":["https://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=acf3ddcf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af820636&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"wordCount":"709","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350640402","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://assets-a1.kompasiana.com/items/album/2019/01/25/images-3-5c4b1dd66ddcae5e8c0b9032.jpeg?t=o&v=1200"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"136682","name":"Kompasiana","homeUrl":"https://www.kompasiana.com","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Indonesia","countryCode":"ID","region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"6.10","pageAuthority":"61.00","domainAuthority":"81.00","externalLinks":"2838191","links":"3326378"}},"feed":{"id":"236029393","name":"Kompasiana","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940764852","id":"38350722397","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"Wind Turbine Operations and Maintenance Market Foraying Into Emerging Economies 2018 to 2026","content":"Rockville, MD -- (SBWIRE) -- 01/25/2019 --  Wind is a form of solar energy and is a result of uneven heating of the atmosphere and the irregularities of the earth's surface.

The gearbox in the wind turbine operations and maintenance needs to be lubricated to improve life of wind turbine. Several fully synthetic oils are available in the market designed especially for wind turbine operations and maintenance is gaining traction over the decade as it is vital for proper functioning of wind turbine operations and maintenance. Owing to remote placements of wind turbines, gear oils are replaced at every six months, thereby use of quality gear oils that are highly expensive is the key facet that is limiting the growth of global wind turbine operations and maintenance market.  \n\nAlong with the gear box of wind turbines, generator bearing and blade bearing need to be lubricated periodically in a bid to avoid obstruction in the process. There are several lubrication points on the blades which needs to be filled with oil carefully. Wind tower blade bearings require lubrications also blade bearings require lubrication to optimize blade angle to match wind speed. The main shaft bearing in the wind turbine operations and maintenance and pitch drivers also needs lubrication in order to perform smooth and efficient operation. A hydraulic system installed in the wind turbine operations and maintenance that deliver breaking mechanism further needs periodic lubrication. Various parts that require lubrication are vital factors that are influencing growth of global wind turbine operations and maintenance market.

launches NaturCEASE solution for fresh processed meats","content":"USA � Kemin Industries, global\nprovider of shelf-life extension and food safety solutions has unveiled a food\ningredient that can keep processed meats that protects their freshness. \n \nThe\nnew solution, NaturCEASE� Dry is a clean-label ingredient that responds to\nincreasing need for fresh and tasty meat products that are not added with\nartificial flavors. \n \nAccording\nto the company, it also protects the meat from losing flavour or colour,\ncharacteristics that are associated with the quality of the products. \n \nNaturCEASE\nDry was developed through a combination of buffered vinegar and natural plant\nextracts bringing with them multiple benefits of freshness and safety. \n \nIt\nworks by controlling spoilage bacteria while maintaining the bright red colour\nand fresh flavour of processed meat products, providing the needed convenience\nand user-friendliness to meat manufacturers.  \n \n�Meat spoilage can be divided into two criteria: oxidative rancidity and microbial spoilage. \n \nBoth have a sensory impact and an impact on colour, but, more importantly, microbial contamination affects meat safety,� said Anja Verbiest, Customer Laboratory Services and Quality Assurance Manager, Kemin Food Technologies � EMEA. \n \nThe new product protects meat from spoilage thus addresses the oxidation and color issues and microbial contamination which has an impact on sensory and safety characteristics of meat. \n \nNaturCEASE\nDry helps meat manufacturers to better meet demand for clean label and\nnatural ingredients. \n \n�Our NaturCEASE Dry solution offers a total freshness package. It�s user-friendly for customers and provides the needed convenience they seek,� said Kelly De Vadder, Marketing Manager, Kemin Food Technologies � EMEA. \n \nIn\nMay, Kemin introduced NaturFORT RSGT, a blend of rosemary, spearmint and green\ntea plant extracts that has been found to provide shelf-life extension in salad\ndressings and sauces. \n \nThis\nis an alternative to previously used products such as Ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA). \n \nThe Des\nMoines, Iowa-based company is looking to address the need for plant-based\nalternatives as manufacturers seek a replacement for previously used artificial\nproducts. \n  RELATED

Service Implications For Contracting Parties And Disputes","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Brexit date of 29 March 2019 is fast approaching, and there is now a distinct possibility of the UK leaving the EU without agreed terms. Our MoFo Brexit Task Force is coordinating Brexit-related legal analysis across all of our offices, and working with clients on key concerns and issues, now and in the coming weeks and months. We are also continuing to provide MoFo Brexit Briefings on a range of key issues. We are here to support you in any and every way that we can.From a commercial contracting and disputes perspective, Brexit has the potential to impact four key areas: jurisdiction; recognition and enforcement of judgments; service; and governing law. This update note focuses on the third of these areas - service. You can find our update notes on the other three areas here[1].As with other areas, it is difficult to predict what the exact impact of Brexit will be on these matters until we know what post-Brexit model and terms the UK and the EU will agree, if any agreement is reached at all. In the meantime, uncertainty remains. That said, there are some practical steps that parties entering into or renegotiating contracts can take now to seek to protect themselves from the impact of Brexit and the intervening uncertainty.How easy will it be to serve proceedings on EU parties post-Brexit?Brexit is likely to impact the ease with which parties in EU Member States can be served with proceedings.The current regimeUnder the Recast Brussels Regulation, permission to serve English proceedings in another EU Member State is generally not required. In addition, the EU Service Regulation provides a clear and predictable process for effecting service of English proceedings in EU Member States and vice versa.Post-Brexit optionsPost-Brexit, the Recast Brussels Regulation and the EU Service Regulation will cease to apply in the UK. This has been confirmed in the draft Service of Documents and Taking of Evidence in Civil and Commercial Matters (Revocation and Saving Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018. Although it is theoretically possible for the UK and the EU to agree that the Recast Brussels Regulation and EU Service Regulation, or equivalent agreements, will continue to apply, this is unlikely.Whatever international treaty the UK adopts (if any), the process of effecting service in EU Member States is likely to be slower and less predictable post-Brexit. The government has previously announced its desire to participate in the Lugano Convention post-Brexit (although noting its view that the Lugano Convention is limited in scope) and its desire to explore a bilateral agreement with the EU. A similar exemption to the requirement to obtain permission to serve out of the jurisdiction applies under the Lugano Convention as under the Recast Brussels Regulation.The UK also originally signed and ratified, in its own right and prior to joining the EU, the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters Convention (\"Hague Service Convention\"), which will continue to apply post-Brexit (including between the UK and those EU Member States that are signatories to it). The Hague Service Convention permits contracting states to designate a Central Authority to receive and execute requests for service from other contracting states. In most cases, however, service under the Hague Service Convention is likely to be considerably slower than under the existing EU Service Regulation.No-deal BrexitOn 13 September 2018, the UK government published guidance on \"Handling civil legal cases that involve EU countries if there's no Brexit deal\". As the guidance notes, in a \"no-deal\" scenario, the UK would \"revert to the existing domestic common law and statutory rules\". Service will need to be effected under the Hague Service Convention (in those EU Member States that are signatories to that convention) or another bilateral service treaty. Alternatively, in any states for which there is no applicable convention or treaty in place, parties will have to apply to the English court for permission to serve proceedings in those EU Member States under English law civil procedure rules (as is presently the case with respect to service in other countries outside the EU). This would create an additional (albeit generally surmountable) hurdle to bringing proceedings against parties in EU Member States, with associated substantial time and cost implications.What you should do nowA common practical workaround to address problems of service abroad (and avoid the need to apply for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction) is to include an agent for service of process clause in contracts, providing an address for service in England and Wales. It would therefore be advisable in the short-to-medium term to ensure that such a clause is included in all contracts with EU parties.MoFo Brexit TaskforceThe process of Brexit will take many years, and the implications for our clients' businesses will unfold over time. Our MoFo Brexit Task Force is coordinating Brexit-related legal analysis across all of our offices, and working with clients on key concerns and issues, now and in the coming weeks and months. We will also continue to provide MoFo Brexit Briefings on a range of key issues.

Terhadap dua muncikari sebagai pihak yang memfasilitasi prostitusi dan menjadikan kegiatannya sebagai mata pencaharian secara jelas hukum pidana (KUHP) menjeratnya berdasarkan Pasal 296 jo Pasal 506 KUHP dengan ancaman hukuman maksimal satu tahun empat bulan. Meski ancaman di bawah lima tahun hukum acara pidana (KUHAP) menentukannya sebagai kejahatan yang dapat dilakukan penahanan. \n\nMuncul persoalan mengapa hanya muncikari yang terjerat, sementara pelaku prostitusi dalam hal ini pekerja sex komersil dan pengggunanya tidak dapat dijerat KUHP ? Sepertinya \"hukum pidana\" Indonesia tidak adil dan diskriminatif. Ketentuan Pasal 506 KUHP berada di bawah pengaturan Bab tentang Ketertiban Umum bersama pengaturan tentang pembuat keributan, pengemis, dan gelandangan yang keseluruhan ancaman hukumannya adalah kurungan. Sangat mungkin karena hal ini beberapa Pemerintah Daerah khususnya Pemda DKI Jakarta menerbitkan Peraturan Daerah No.8 Tahun 2007 tentang Ketertiban Umum yang dalam ketentuan pasal 42 ayat (2) mengatur bahwa diancam dengan hukuman minimal 20 hari dan maksimal 90 hari atau denda minimum 500 ribu rupiah dan maksimum 30 juta rupiah bagi a. Muncikari ( setiap orang yang menyuruh, memfasilitasi, membujuk atau memaksa orang untuk menjadi pekerja sex komersial), b.mereka yang menjadi pekerja sex komersial dan c.mereka yang menggunakan jasa pekerja sex komersial. \n\nTidak hanya itu, para pelaku prostitusi yang sudah terikat pada perkawinan juga bisa dijerat dengan ketentuan pasal 284 KUHP mengenai perzinahan, hanya saja tindak pidana perzinahan ini bersifat aduan, artinya jika pihak suami atau istri dari para pelaku perselingkuhan tidak mengadukan, maka para pelaku proistitusi itu bebas dar jeratan hukum.  Demikian halnya dalam konteks prostitusi online, maka jika bisa dibuktikan \"inisiasi\" pemarasan online atas permintaan pekerja seks komersial (PSK), maka ketentuan pasal 55 KUHP bisa diterapkan kepada PSK sebagai pelaku peserta yang menyuruh muncikari untuk menayangkannya pada ranah online. \n\nHal yang menarik sebenarnya kejahatan prostitusi ini berpotensi juga melanggar tindak pidana pencucian uang, jika uang yang dihasilkan dari kejahatan kemudian sengaja  disamarkan. Prostitusi termasuk tindak pidana asal yang disebutkan dalam Pasal 2 ayat (1) hurup u Undang-undang No. 8 Tahun 2010 tentang Pencegahan dan Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Pencucian Uang ( UU-TPPU) atau tindak pidana ke 21 dari 25 tindak pidana asal yang  disebutkan dalam undang-undang. Penjelasan UU-TPPU menyebutkan yang  dimaksud  dengan  \"prostitusi\"  adalah  prostitusi sebagaimana   dimaksud   dalam   Kitab   Undang-Undang Hukum    Pidana    dan    undang-undang    mengenai pemberantasan tindak pidana perdagangan orang (UU-TPPO). Artinya UU-TPPU hanya mengakui pengertian \"prostitusi\" dalam KUHP dan UU TPPO saja sedangkan pengertian \"prostitusi\" dalam aturan lain termasuk dalam Peraturan Daerah umumnya dan Perda DKI Jakarta khususnya tidak dapat diproses sebagai tindak pidana pencucian uang, meskipun secara subtantif prostitusi yang diatur dalam peraturan apapun adalah sama. \n\nInkonsistensi UU TPPU \n\n  \n\nTidak hanya soal pengertian \"prostitusi\" yang inkonsisten, UU-TPPU juga menyimpan lofthole lainnya yang pada gilirannya akan melahirkan kekaburan dan ketidak pastian hukum. Sebagai contoh penentuan jenis 25 tindak pidana asal yang berpotensi melahirkan pencucian uang dengan parameter yang tidak jelas, disatu sisi membatasi tindak pidana yang ancaman hukumannya minimal 4 tahun (Pasal 2 ayat 1 huruf z UU-TPPU) dilain pihak ada ancaman hukuman di salah satu atau dua dari 25 tindak pidana asal yang ancaman hukumannya dibawah 4 tahun, yaitu Prostitusi yang ancaman pidananya hanya 1 tahun 4 bulan penjara (pasal 296 KUHP) dan perjudian yang ancaman hukumannya 2 tahun 8 bulan (Pasal 303 KUHP).  \n\n  \n\nTujuan dibuatnya UU-TPPU selain mengejar dan menghukum pelaku, juga dimaksudkan untuk merampas harta kekayaan yang diperoleh dari tindak pidana asal yang kemudian harta kekayaan asal tersebut disamarkan atau dikaburkan atau dicuci seolah-olah harta kekayaan yang diperoleh secara legal. Oleh karena itu, seharusnya semua kejahatan yang bermotif ekonomi harus dijadikan tindak pidana asal dari tindak pidana pencucian uang berapapun ancaman hukuman pidananya, sehingga pembatasan tindak pidana asal minimal yanbg ancaman hukuman pidananya  4 tahun menjadi tidak beralasan dan harus diamandemen. \n\nDemikian halnya dengan soal siapa yang punya kewenangan dan sekaligus kemampuan untuk menyidik TPPU ? Pasal 74 UU-TPPU menyatakan bahwa penyidikan  tindak  pidana  Pencucian  Uang  dilakukan  oleh penyidik tindak pidana asal sesuai dengan ketentuan hukum acara   dan   ketentuan   peraturan   perundang-undangan. Namun dalam penjelasan pasal 74 ini justru nampak perubahan terselubung atau lahirnya norma baru yang mengenyampingkan batang tubuh pasal 74 ini, yaitu menentukan bahwa justru pengertian \"penyidik tindak pidana asal\" itu dibatasi secara terbatas hanya pada Kepolisian  Negara  Republik  Indonesia, Kejaksaan,  Komisi  Pemberantasan  Korupsi  (KPK),  Badan  Narkotika Nasional  (BNN),  serta  Direktorat  Jenderal  Pajak  dan  Direktorat Jenderal Bea dan Cukai Kementerian Keuangan Republik Indonesia. Ini artinya penjelasan pasal 74 telah meredusir norma pokoknya, hal yang demikian berdasarkan UU No.12 Tahun 2011 tentang Tata Urutan Perundang-undangan harus dibatalkan. \n\nPenjelasan pasal 74 UU-TPPU ini harus dihapus dan dibatalkan begitu pendapat Ahli Pidana dari Universitas Gajahmada Prof. Eddy OS Hiariej, karena pasal 74 justru memberikan penyidik tindak pidana asal sesuai dengan ketentuan hukum acara   dan   ketentuan   peraturan   perundang-undangan. Penyidik tindak pidana asal tersebut adalah penyidik yang berwenang menangani tindak pidana korupsi; penyuapan; narkotika; psikotropika; penyelundupan tenaga kerja; penyelundupan migran; tindak pidana di bidang perbankan; di bidang pasar modal; di bidang perasuransian; kepabeanan; cukai; perdagangan orang; perdagangan senjata gelap; terorisme; penculikan; pencurian; penggelapan; penipuan; pemalsuan uang; perjudian;  prostitusi; di bidang perpajakan; di bidang kehutanan;  di bidang lingkungan hidup;  di bidang kelautan dan perikanan; atau tindak  pidana  lain  yang  bermotif ekonomi tanpa mempertimbangkan jumlah ancam pidananya. \n\nYa, potensi TPPU memang bisa timbul pada kejahatan sekecil apapun, karena memang kejahatan pencucian uang merupakan kejahatan yang berkaitan dengan dampak ekonomi. Sehingga, semua kejahatan asal di dalam tindak pencucian uang, bermotif ekonomi, dan menyimpan nilai ekonomi yang sangat besar. Masyarakat harus mengetahui dan mengawasinya, karena itu kampanye tentang apa dan bagaimana kejahatan pencucian uang mesti diketahui banyak orang, paling tidak jika anda menyaksikan film layar lebar \"Milly dan Mamet\" secara sederhana akan mengerti apa itu cuci uang ketika sebuah konglomerasi secara antusias masuk ke bisnis cafresto skala kecil. Smoga kesadaran kita bisa membantu mengembalikan kekayaan Negara yang terus mengalir kepada pihak yang tidak berhak.(25119)","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:56:33Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:56:33Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722423&p=4s5&v=1&x=FBOwAKPhs-kU1btFJCCE5Q","outboundUrls":["https://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=acf3ddcf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://ads8.kompasads.com/new/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af820636&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"wordCount":"936","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350722423","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://assets-a1.kompasiana.com/items/album/2019/01/25/perpus-5c4b234d43322f03716b3414.jpg?t=o&v=1200"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"136682","name":"Kompasiana","homeUrl":"https://www.kompasiana.com","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Indonesia","countryCode":"ID","region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"6.10","pageAuthority":"61.00","domainAuthority":"81.00","externalLinks":"2838191","links":"3326378"}},"feed":{"id":"236029393","name":"Kompasiana","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940765439","id":"38350722427","language":"Hindi","languageCode":"hi","title":"?????? ???? ?? ????? ??????????","content":"?????? ?? ??????? ????? ?? ???????? ?? ????????? ?????? ???? ????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ?????? ????? ???? ?? ????? ???? ???? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????????? ????? ???????? ?? ?????? ????? ????, ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????????, ???? ???????? ??????, ?????? ???????? ???? ???? ????? ?? ???????? ?? ??????? ????? ?? ??? ????? ???","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:45:49Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:45:49Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722427&p=4s5&v=1&x=HZA9WJmvQI1ycuegKPqVsg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"59","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350722427","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"CLA"}],"source":{"id":"30186","name":"Live Hindustan","homeUrl":"https://www.livehindustan.com","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"India","countryCode":"IN","region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"5.20","pageAuthority":"52.00","domainAuthority":"59.00","externalLinks":"2458355","links":"3589363"}},"feed":{"id":"169660085","name":"Live Hindustan","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940765554","id":"38350722429","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"\"Well Hello There\" LO by DT Lori","content":"It's Friday!

Governing Law Implications For Contracting Parties And Disputes","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Brexit date of 29 March 2019 is fast approaching, and there is now a distinct possibility of the UK leaving the EU without agreed terms. Our MoFo Brexit Task Force is coordinating Brexit-related legal analysis across all of our offices, and working with clients on key concerns and issues, now and in the coming weeks and months. We are also continuing to provide MoFo Brexit Briefings on a range of key issues. We are here to support you in any and every way that we can.From a commercial contracting and disputes perspective, Brexit has the potential to impact four key areas: jurisdiction; recognition and enforcement of judgments; service; and governing law. This update note focuses on the last of these areas - governing law. You can find our update notes on the other three areas here[1].As with other areas, it is difficult to predict what the exact impact of Brexit will be on these matters until we know what post-Brexit model and terms the UK and the EU will agree, if any agreement is reached at all. In the meantime, uncertainty remains. That said, there are some practical steps that parties entering into or renegotiating contracts can take now to seek to protect themselves from the impact of Brexit and the intervening uncertainty.Will your choice of governing law be upheld post-Brexit?The current regimeThe Rome I Regulation (\"Rome I\") and Rome II Regulation (\"Rome II\") apply to contractual and non-contractual/tortious obligations, respectively, and provide that courts will uphold the parties' choice of law, whether or not the chosen law is that of an EU Member State.Post-Brexit optionsPost-Brexit, Rome I and Rome II will continue to apply in the remaining EU Member States. This means that Brexit should not affect the approach currently taken by EU courts, which will continue to give effect to commercial parties' choice of English governing law in their contracts. Further, while the UK government will need to incorporate Rome I and Rome II into domestic law, it has publicly stated that it will do so. On 13 September 2018, the government published guidance on \"Handling civil legal cases that involve EU countries if there's no Brexit deal\", in which it noted (among other things) that all parts of the UK would retain Rome I and Rome II, which do not generally rely on reciprocity in order to operate. This intention has now been confirmed by the draft Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations and Non-contractual Obligations (Amendment Etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018, which preserve Rome I and Rome II subject to technical amendments to ensure they remain workable post-Brexit.What you should do nowPost-Brexit, commercial parties can generally be confident that their contractual choice of English governing law will be respected and enforced in both England ...les and the remaining EU Member States. However, caution should be exercised in certain cases, for example, in relation to insurance contracts covering \"non-large\" risks in Member States and unfair competition affecting the market in more than one country, in which a Member State court applying the EU Regulations could reach a different conclusion to a UK court operating under the retained Regulations.What about arbitration?The EU rules on governing law under Rome I and Rome II do not extend to arbitration.Brexit is therefore unlikely to have any adverse impact on arbitration. This could make arbitration an attractive option for contracting parties seeking to obtain certainty - at least until the post-Brexit position becomes clearer.MoFo Brexit TaskforceThe process of Brexit will take many years, and the implications for our clients' businesses will unfold over time. Our MoFo Brexit Task Force is coordinating Brexit-related legal analysis across all of our offices, and working with clients on key concerns and issues, now and in the coming weeks and months. We will also continue to provide MoFo Brexit Briefings on a range of key issues. We are here to support you in any and every way that we can.Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.

Hauptbahnhof Dortmund Trotz Flucht �ber Gleise: Polizei fasst zwei mutma�liche Graffiti-Seriensprayer","content":"Trotz Flucht �ber Gleise: Polizei fasst zwei mutma�liche Graffiti-Seriensprayer Hauptbahnhof Dortmund Observierungserfolg am Hauptbahnhof: Die Polizei hat am Donnerstag zwei mutma�liche Graffiti-Serient�ter festgenommen. Bei der Durchsuchung ihrer Wohnungen fanden die Ermittler noch mehr. von Thomas Thiel Dortmund, 25.01.2019 Bundespolizisten beobachteten die beiden M�nner - einen 37-J�hrigen aus Dortmund und einen 26-J�hrigen aus M�lheim an der Ruhr - gegen 22 Uhr bei einer Observierung der Abstellgleise des Dortmunder Hauptbahnhofs, wie sie sich Zutritt zu einem Zug der S-Bahn 2 verschafften. Als sie einen Beamten im Zug bemerkten, flohen sie �ber die Gleise. \n\nDen Dortmunder konnte die Polizei kurz darauf im Bereich der Unionstra�e festnehmen. Der M�lheimer wurde gefasst, als er zu seinem Auto zur�ckkehrte, �welches bereits durch Einsatzkr�fte observiert wurde�, so die Bundespolizei in einer Pressemitteilung. \n\nPolizei findet Beweismaterial in Wohnungen der Sprayer \n\nNach R�cksprache mit der zust�ndigen Staatsanwaltschaft durchsuchte die Polizei die Wohnungen der M�nner. Dabei wurde nach Angaben der Bundespolizei umfangreiches Beweismaterial sichergestellt. In der M�lheimer Wohnung fanden sie zudem Drogen. \n\nGegen die beiden polizeibekannten M�nner wurden Strafverfahren wegen Hausfriedensbruch, Sachbesch�digung eingeleitet. Der 26-J�hrige muss sich zudem wegen unerlaubten Drogenbesitzes verantworten. \n\nPolizei wirft M�nnern weitere Spray-Aktionen vor \n\nDar�ber hinaus laufen weitere Ermittlungen gegen die beiden M�nner. Die Bundespolizei verd�chtigt sie, f�r mehrere Graffiti verantwortlich zu sein. Ob sie auch etwas mit dem besonders spektakul�ren Fall von Silvester zu tun hatte, als Sprayer einen Zug am Haltepunkt Dortmund-West mit Nebelbomben und Einkaufswagen an der Weiterfahrt hinderten, wisse man noch nicht, so ein Sprecher.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:56:46Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:51Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:56:46Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350722446&p=4s5&v=1&x=4Og70XWpCUnNfbfO2JsUMA","outboundUrls":["http://de.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.halternerzeitung.de/nachrichten/dortmund/trotz-flucht-ueber-gleise-polizei-fasst-zwei-mutmassliche-graffiti-seriensprayer-1369390.html","https://ticker4u.de/","https://www.lensingmedia.de/mediadaten/","https://ruhr24jobs.de/","https://immo.ruhrnachrichten.de/","https://oaa.medienhaus-lensing.de/"],"wordCount":"238","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350711634","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"GERICHTSPROZESSE","score":"73"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"VERHAFTUNGEN","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"VANDALISMUS","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"BEWEIS","score":"73"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"ERMITTLUNGEN","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"POLIZEIKR�FTE","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"DROGENKRIMINALIT�T","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"PRESSEMITTEILUNGEN","score":"72"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"KRIMINALERMITTLUNGEN","score":"90"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"EIGENTUMSDELIKTE","score":"78"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"NORDRHEIN-WESTFALEN, DEUTSCHLAND","score":"73"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"DORTMUND, DEUTSCHLAND","score":"90"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.0","entities":[{"type":"Location","value":"M�lheim","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true}]},"author":{"name":"Thomas Thiel","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"58568","name":"Halterner Zeitung","homeUrl":"https://www.halternerzeitung.de","category":"Local","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"4.70","pageAuthority":"47.00","domainAuthority":"50.00","externalLinks":"381315","links":"547518"}},"feed":{"id":"378898184","name":"Halterner Zeitung","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940765991","id":"38350721766","language":"Chinese","languageCode":"zh","title":"�15???�????,??????(??)","content":"????

Citando cuatro fuentes distintas, el diario explica que Zuckerberg quiere crear una infraestructura tecnol�gica com�n para Instagram, Whatsapp y Facebook Messenger, como primer paso para que los servicios sean al menos interoperables; es decir, que puedan enviarse mensajes entre ellos independientemente del servicio. \n\nEsto supondr�a que los usuarios tendr�an acceso al menos a qui�n usa otra red social, una circunstancia que ahora a�n no es posible. Hasta ahora, todas las empresas funcionan de forma aut�noma y con su estructura original. \n\nLa matriz Facebook Inc compr� Instagram en abril del 2012, dos a�os despu�s de su creaci�n y el anuncio casi coincidi� con la salida de la versi�n para Android, cuando ya ten�a la de iPhone desde su lanzamiento. Whatsapp fue adquirida por Facebook en febrero del 2014.\n\nFuera de la empresa \n\nLos fundadores de ambas compa��as pasaron a formar parte del staff de Facebook Inc, pero en los �ltimos meses han ido abandonando la multinacional, conforme han sabido los planes para sus respectivas compa��as. \n\nSeg�n The New York Times, la �nica condici�n que ha puesto Zuckerberg para integrar todos los servicios es que se mantenga la encriptaci�n punto a punto que tiene ahora Whatsapp en todos los servicios. Esto permite que los mensajes no se almacenen en servidores externos sino solo en los m�viles de los usuarios implicados en la conversaci�n (y de ah� se pueden guardar, por ejemplo, en el iCloud de Apple) y por tanto que la compa��a no tenga acceso a los mensajes.\n\nTambi�n cuestiona si Zuckerberg se ve fuerte para cobrar por el servicio.\n\nEsta por ver tambi�n, aunque el diario neoyorquino no lo se�ala, c�mo va a encarar la Comisi�n Europea y sus autoridades de competencia la fusi�n tecnol�gica de tantos servicios tan utilizados.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:55:44Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:55:44Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721775&p=4s5&v=1&x=bVR60QalWWKDNRL56aAJgQ","outboundUrls":["https://www.diariolagrada.com/","http://entrades.elperiodico.cat/","https://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/","https://www.facebook.com/elperiodico.catalunya","https://twitter.com/elperiodico","https://plus.google.com/+elperiodico","https://www.instagram.com/elperiodico_cas/","http://www.grupozeta.es/publicidad/","http://www.grupozeta.es/","https://www.sport.es/es/","https://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/","https://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/","https://www.diariocordoba.com/","https://www.lacronicabadajoz.com/","https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/","https://www.woman.es/","https://www.cuore.es/","http://www.primeralinea.es/","http://www.interviu.es/","http://www.tiempodehoy.com/","https://www.stilo.es/","http://www.digitalcamera.es/","https://www.autohebdosport.es/","https://www.zetakiosko.com/"],"wordCount":"347","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721775","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/0/3/1462267494130.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"Internet

Highlights are below: On how much training she had when she debuted: 'Up to that point? So I think I was around like maybe starting No, wait. I went to the [Performance Center] for my bachelorette party, I think it was July or something 'cause I got married in August. [Brian Kendrick's wrestling school] was like, right after I went to the PC that first time�my bachelorette party. My bachelorette party, I gave myself a week-long tryout. I just said, 'Hi guys, I'm coming. I've got a bachelorette party.' What kind of a weird way to ask for a tryout, right? Okay, I didn't really say that. What I actually said was more like, 'Listen, I'm getting married after my bachelorette party. And all my girls are out there training. I want to go out there and train with them for a week just to spend time with them for a week. And then we're all going to take a Cruise America and RV back to LA.' On training with Lacey Evans, Dakota Kai, and Sara Amato: '[Sara's] a genius. She really is brilliant. So they spent a couple days with me just trying to figure out moves and whatever. Lacey Evans was the first person to take a 'Piper's Pit.' We were trying to figure it out. Dakota Kai was the first person to take the 'Sup-ladle,' which no one knows is called the 'Sup-ladle.' That one I kind of it's like suplex and a cradle, right? So I call it the 'Sup-ladle,' like a soup ladle. I had 'Sup-ladle,' and 'The Backpack' is that one I did to Alexa Bliss and Charlotte with the legs and the arm. And I do the little flip. The wind up and then the flip.' On her Rumble debut: 'So this was my first experience really going out in the WWE. They sneak me in doing this whole Super Mario tunnel thing. And then I'm crouched behind�I think Shane McMahon was there too. And I was pretty much in the circle of Vince and Triple H and Shane, hidden behind them. And then Triple H says, 'Okay, it's time. We have to go out.' And he tells me, 'Have fun,' or whatever. I don't know what he said. And so I went. And I thought I'd be booed out of the building. I thought the way they had me walk in I was kind of stepping on Asuka's moment. But, you know. I came out and I felt it and just kind of�Asuka pointed twice, so I pointed three times. Yeah, yeah, no, I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know what I was doing at all.'

'caliphate' in Syria will be defeated within a month: commander","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Military operations against the Islamic State group in Syria are wrapping up and the last pocket of the jihadists' \"caliphate\" will be flushed out within a month, a top commander said.\"The operation of our forces against IS in its last pocket has reached its end and IS fighters are now surrounded in one area,\" Mazloum Kobani, the chief of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told AFP.With backing from the US-led coalition, the SDF are in the last phase of an operation started on September 10 to defeat the jihadists in the Euphrates Valley in eastern Syria.\"We need a month to eliminate IS remnants still in the area,\" said Kobani, who spoke to AFP on Thursday near the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakeh.A few hundred IS fighters are defending a handful of hamlets near the Iraqi border, the last rump of a \"caliphate\" which the jihadist organisation proclaimed in 2014 and once covered territory the size of Britain.\"I believe that during the next month we will officially announce the end of the military presence on the ground of the so-called caliphate,\" Kobani said.Intense fighting in the area known as \"the Hajin pocket\" has left hundreds of fighters dead on both sides, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.IS lost the town of Hajin late last year and the subsequent collapse of its defences saw the Kurdish-led SDF conquer one village after another.Kobani said their battle had been complicated by the jihadist group's shifting strategy after the fall of their de-facto Syrian capital of Raqa in 2017.New tactics include \"sleeper cells everywhere, secretly recruiting people again, and carrying out suicide operations, bombings, and assassinations\", he said.\"We expect there will be an increase in the intensity of IS operations against our forces after the end of their military presence,\" Kobani said.IS has retained a presence in Syria's vast Badia desert and has claimed a series of attacks in SDF-held territory.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721782&p=4s5&v=1&x=s-ev-qUZoozorvzVRqN6Cg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"341","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

What's next for EUR/GBP? Here is their view, courtesy of eFXdata:Danske Research discusses EUR/GBP outlook and sees a scope for a move lower towards 0.8600 in the near-term. 'GBP outperformed in the G10 space yesterday supported by a technical break above 1.30 in GBP/USD. While uncertainty related to Brexit remains high, the risk of a 'no deal' Brexit appears to be fading, which has improved appetite for GBP. We reckon that the past week's rally in GBP is fair given that the 'post Brexit' outcome distribution for EUR/GBP looks increasingly skewed towards the downside,' Danske notes. 'Momentum is strong and with risks skewed towards the downside for EUR, EUR/GBP could still test lower towards 0.86 in the coming days,' Danske adds.

You�ve switched partners, became single to focus on you, or tried to shake out your routine. Yet you still feel like happiness is unreachable. Why is that so? Read on for ways to change the way you think and start living a more content life! \n BEAT BAD HABITS  \nThere are certain habits that we don�t know that we have.  You might spend too much time on social media and not get enough work done, and this may frustrate the people around you.  The problem isn�t the social media�the problem is that the work isn�t being done.  Their reaction to you may shock you and upset you because, in your mind, you didn�t deserve it.  But if you think about it, nobody would have gotten upset over your social media habits if the work was done on time. \n \nSomeone might have said something to you like �It�s always the same thing with you� or �this is exactly what happened last time.� I believe that sometimes, it really is just the situation you�re in.  But other times, when it�s easier to blame the situation rather than do some introspection and change yourself for the better, I think that is the time when you really have to knuckle-down and brave face through the transition that will ultimately change the entire trajectory of your life. \n \nIf you start noticing a pattern or a continuous thread of responses from the people around you, it�s time to seriously start thinking about the impact your attitude has on your everyday life�and especially your future. \n \n\n THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ARE CONNECTED  \nActivating your brain to start noticing the things you do that is causing you to behave in ways that may be destructive to others is no easy task.  You basically have to dissect yourself and find out what the root of your behavioral issues are.  And that is daunting.  I�ve been listening to Dr. Caroline Leaf recently and find her books very helpful.  She speaks about controlling your thoughts and switching on your brain. This is basically the idea that your thoughts control your feelings, and your feelings control your behavior. \n \nIf you can control your thoughts and how you think, you can control how you feel�which means you can control your reactions to different triggers and situations. \n \nWe all think that we can�t help how we feel.  And perhaps we can�t, but we certainly can help how we respond to our feelings. Have you ever thought yourself into a bad mood?  If you can do that then, as hard as it sounds, surely you can think yourself into a good mood. \n FOCUS ON YOU  \nIf you feel that you are always unlucky, that the world is always against you, or that everyone always treats you with disrespect and nobody sees how much you do for everyone, maybe you should go back to the beginning and work on yourself first.  Take some real time out. Away from everything and everyone.  Take a diary and write down all the things that affect your emotions and ask yourself why they do. Write down everything that makes you happy and what you can do to motivate your happiness.  Write down ways you think you can experience that happiness more often and how you can increase moments of happiness into a longer lasting state of being�rather than just bouts of happiness which are dependant on external influences. \n  CHANGE YOUR POV  \nThe best way to change other people is to start by changing yourself.  And I know that they say you can�t change other people, you can only change how you react to them.  But I believe something different.  I believe that if you work on yourself and develop skills that will conform to you � not to anyone else�s standard � the people around you and the relationships you have will automatically change.  And in that and as much as you don�t really change the people around you, you certainly change their perception of you and the way that they respond to you.  For instance, if you walk past a colleague for months without saying hello to them, chances are that they won�t see the need to say hello to you.  But if you change the way that you see them and stop one day to find out how their evening was, chances are that they will respond well to that and then one day, they might even start the conversation with you.  Do you see how the colleague in that scenario �changed� from not seeing the need to say hello to you to initiating the conversation?  In this scenario, you might think �Wow, the colleague really changed a lot� but, when you unpack it, you find that the real person who changed was you. \n \nIf we focus our energy on ourselves, we can all change the way we respond to situations.  You might think that you can�t help yourself, but if you put the same dedication into yourself that you put into trying to change everybody else, you will soon learn that you can help yourself.  You can change how you think and feel.  You can decide not to blow up a situation.  You do have the power. It resides within you. \n \nSurround yourself with positive influences�download Hey!

It still hopes it can take military control of the whole region\".\"It needs... to understand that is impossible.\"Kobani said the SDF were however prepared to \"protect the Syrian border and the unity of Syrian territory\".And they would \"accept the results of centralised elections if they occurred\".","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721789&p=4s5&v=1&x=mjFZ6g7EOyR19p_IIwb4jg","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"360","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

S had an extensive and deep wound that wouldn't heal and was suffering sepsis which threatened his life. S's family did not agree with the treating medical team, and disputed that S lacked capacity, or that S needed surgery. All of the attempts at exploring concerns and seeking agreement had been unsuccessful.After six months as an in-patient, where the 'watchful waiting' conservative approach had been taken, the Trust had reduced S's BMI, which significantly reduced the risk of death associated with the surgery. However, the wound had not healed, the episodes of sepsis were occurring more frequently and the risk of developing an antibiotic-resistant infection were high. The treating medical team wanted S to undergo surgery, to provide the best chance of recovery; they couldn't agree to stand back and continue to wait. As a result, we applied to the Court of Protection and a date was listed for the matter to be heard approximately two months after the date of application.Mr Justice Moor heard from Fiona Paterson of 39 Essex Chambers and evidence from the treating clinicians. The Official Solicitor, representing S, agreed at court with the Order we requested. After consideration, Mr Justice Moor agreed with the NHS Trust, that surgery was both urgent and in the best interests of S.This published judgment may be useful for others becauseMr Justice Moor sets out the legal tests to be applied in determining the patient's best interests in a simple and understandable way (paragraphs 33-36);The patient's best interests were decided in the absence of oral evidence from the family and despite their objection to the surgical treatment; andMr Justice Moor refused to grant an application from the family to adjourn the hearing (in advance), and decided to continue the hearing in their absence (when they did not attend the Royal Courts of Justice) because proper notice had been given.The case highlights the weight which the Court of Protection will place on hearing multi-disciplinary medical evidence when considering the best interests of a patient, particularly where the patient's family disagree that surgery is appropriate.After the surgery was performed, S's health improved significantly and they were discharged from hospital.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Ms Gemma BranniganClyde ...

Store, Gand�a","content":"Seeking to be much more than a store, the provocative and irreverent Pewter is a lifestyle and sportswear concept in Gand�a on the east coast of Spain. Conceived as a place to wow generations Y and Z to hangout, Pewter has immersed itself into the all-consuming world of social media; positioning itself as a worship ground for the selfie. Merging urban and technological sensations, the retail concept�developed by CuldeSac� Custom�is an explosion of stimuli; colour and messaging chosen on its ability to connect with the language and style of its target generations. As the brand�s flagship property, the store intends to be an extension of the road, leading in its potential customers and winding them through a futuristic vision of the urban landscape. PEWTER HAS A NEW LIFESTYLE AND THIS IS A F*CKING SPACE FOR YOU. PEWTER BREAKING THE INTERNET. #PEWTERSTORE screams the signage from the shop�s fa�ade�not just grabbing the attention of passers by, rather handling them around the scruff of the neck and dragging them inside. Things don�t get much quieter on the inside. Situated under a roof of yellow rock wool, enhanced through a grid of LED tubes, exposed cabling and sockets define the impulsive philosophy of the brand and its authenticity; exhibiting what others keep hidden from view. �Giving visibility to everything that has up till now been hidden is part of the brand�s identity,� reveals CuldeSac� Custom creative director, Borja Berna. �Not everything has to be integrated, embedded, measured. We prefer the spontaneous, the natural. We shed these complexes and reflect it in all the aspects of the brand: interior design, graphic identity and communication.� In an age where the retail store has become an extension of brand identity, where a place on the high street is your chance to shout to a new audience, Pewter takes its opportunity and runs like the perpetrator of a particularly chaotic smash-and-grab. Whether its to snap up some new sneakers, or simply serve as a backdrop for a selfie, any attention is good attention for Gand�a�s loudmouth lifestyle brand. @culdesac_es Pewter Gandia Photography, courtesy CuldeSac� Custom","tags":["Shopping","Shops","Concept Stores","Social Media","Valencia","Fashion"],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:45:38Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T14:45:38Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721793&p=4s5&v=1&x=aaE7kyES23zKSEyD7KX1jw","outboundUrls":["http://www.culdesac.es/es","https://instagram.com/culdesac_es"],"wordCount":"348","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721793","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.we-heart.com/upload-images/pewterstorevalencia1366.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"SELFIES","score":"89"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"LIFESTYLE TRENDS","score":"78"},{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"SOCIAL MEDIA","score":"76"},{"domains":["SUB","IND"],"name":"BRANDING","score":"76"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"CITY LIFE","score":"71"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"RETAILERS","score":"73"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"INTERIOR DECORATING","score":"68"},{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"GENERATION Z","score":"77"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"SPAIN","score":"58"}],"companies":[],"locations":[{"name":"Spain","type":"country","mentions":"1","country":{"fipsCode":"SP","isoCode":"es","name":"Spain"},"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","state":{},"provider":"NetOwl"},{"name":"east coast","type":"province","mentions":"1","country":{"fipsCode":"US","isoCode":"us","name":"United States"},"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","state":{"name":"East Coast"},"provider":"NetOwl"}],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Borja Berna"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Borja Berna"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.997"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"Pewter Store"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Pewter Store"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.496"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Person"},{"name":"value","value":"Pewter"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Pewter"},{"name":"instances","value":"2"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.481"}],"provider":"3"}]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.106136486","entities":[{"type":"Location","value":"Spain","mentions":"1","score":"0.137694","evidence":"4","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":" @culdesac_es","mentions":"1","score":"0.49","evidence":"3","confident":true}]},"author":{"name":"Lisa Davidson","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[],"source":{"name":"We Heart","homeUrl":"https://www.we-heart.com","location":{"country":"United Kingdom","countryCode":"GB","region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe"},"metrics":{},"feed":{"id":"112145095","name":"We Heart","mediaType":"Blog","publishingPlatform":"WordPress","generator":"https://wordpress.org/?v=4.9.9","description":"Lifestyle & Design Magazine","tags":[],"language":"English","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"autoRank":"5","autoRankOrder":"30436","inboundLinkCount":"42"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":["ugc food feeds"]}}},{"sequenceId":"915940767280","id":"38350721795","language":"Croatian","languageCode":"hr","title":"Za�to su osudili Huanita na dvije godine zatvora, a famoznog Toma Forda uzimaju za ozbiljno?","content":"RIJEKA Huanito Luksetic iz Bregi kod Matulja morat ce dvije godine u zatvor. Drugostupanjski sud je danas potvrdio presudu rijeckog suda iz studenog 2017. godine, kojom je covjek koji je kanabisovo ulje koristio za lijecenje osuden na dvije godine bezuvjetnog zatvora. Njegovom sumje�taninu Goranu Zakraj�eku izrecena je kazna od 10 mjeseci zatvora.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrugostupanjski sud je neznatno proceduralno ucinio neke promjene u presudi, ali su kazne potvrdene. Rijecki Opcinski sud je ocijenio dokazanim inkriminacije iz optu�nice koja je teretila Luksetica da je u krugu obiteljske kuce u Bregima posjedovao 15 kilograma marihuane radi prodaje na ilegalnom tr�i�tu, a zajedno sa Zakraj�ekom uzgojio 11 stabljika indijske konoplje radi proizvodnje marihuane, s namjerom da se ona proda.\n\n\n5.000 pcelinjih uboda\n\n\n� Znam da zvuci mnogo 15 kilograma, ali s obzirom na kolicinu konoplje koja je meni trebala, to i nije puno. Uzgojio sam konoplju kako bih si spasio �ivot, drasticno sam si pomogao i sretan sam zbog toga. Na uzgoj konoplje gledao sam kao na uzgoj povrca, ne moram se zato ispricavati. Uostalom, dok je konoplja rasla ispred moje kuce, mogla se vidjeti i s javnog puta, konstatirao je prije izricanja prvostupanjske presude Huanito Luksetic, kazav�i i da je na lijecenje ekstraktom kanabisa krenuo nakon �to je probao, uz ostalo, i terapiju s 5.000 pcelinjih uboda.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpetovano je nagla�avao da je kao oboljeli od multiple skleroze uzgoju konoplje i uzimanju kanabisova ulja pri�ao kad je vec sve probao u lijecenju i konvencionalnu medicinu i nekonvencionalne metode. No, sud nije prihvatio tu argumentaciju.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamo par mjeseci prije dana�nje presude na zagrebackom sudu dogodila se ona sinu generala Mladena Kruljca, nakon �to je policija u njegovom stanu prona�la: 4,5 kilograma marihuane, 25 grama kokaina, 10.500 kuna i 117 tisuca eura.\n\n\nCuvanje za Toma Forda\n\n\nDavid Kruljac pravomocno je osuden na kaznu od godinu dana zatvora, no to je potom sporazumno zamijenjeno radom za opce dobro. Mladi Kruljac za kilograme pronadene droge odradit ce 730 sati rada za opce dobro i platiti 200.000 kuna.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoja je bila mladiceva obrana?\n\n\n\n\n\n- Cuvao sam sve to za Toma Forda iz Srbije, rekao je istra�iteljima sin biv�eg zapovjednika hrvatske kopnene vojske.\n\n\n\n\n\nZlata Luksetic, Huanitova majka, �okirana presudom, danas se u razgovoru za Index prisjetila upravo ovog slucaja.\n\n\nSadio je za sebe\n\n\n- Moj sin se borio za sebe, sadio je za sebe, posadio je 11 biljaka razlicitih vrsta da vidi koja mu najvi�e odgovara, da ne mora svake godine strepiti od policije. Zar je to tako te�ko razumljivo.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuanito je imao sve napisano kako se koja biljka zove, za�to nisu snimili kad su skupljali? Nije nikoga Ubio. Nikome nije prodao ni dao, borio se samo za svoje zdravlje. Jesmo li mi ljudi ili nismo, rekla je.\n\n\n\n\n\nKako netko mo�e osuditi bolesnog covjeka na temelju pretpostavke? Kako se mo�e takva optu�ba potvrditi, jesu li ti ljudi normalni, pitala je.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Ako mo�ete, pomozite.. Taj covjek nije ubio mrava, ni mrava nije zgazio. Govori da �ivotinje moraju �ivjeti. Kad po kuci uni�tavam mrave, on mi ka�e da ih ne diram. Ni mrava nije zgazio. Njega su osudili, je li to nije normalno?\n\n\n\n\n\nRecite mi je li onaj Kruljac bolji od mog sina? �to je on bolji? Je li rekao da je za njega, za njega, nije za nikog drugog to bilo. Ne znam kojim rijecima da se borim, kroz plac je govorila Huanitova majka.\n\n\nHodajuci kostur\n\n\nSin generala ce na rad za opce dobro, a Huanito ce na bezuvjetnu robiju, na kojoj mu, bez pretjerivanja, prijeti smrt.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Ja ne mogu dozvoliti da ode tamo. Ne bi izdr�ao. Vi to ne razumijete. Huanito je hodajuci kostur. Ono �to on jede, to nije toliko kaloricno da bi mogao opstati. On jede zelenje, povrce, voce i smoothije. Meso je izbacio, ne jede. Te�ko je tako pre�ivjeti. On je mr�av i jo� uvijek hoda, ali ne mo�ete tako �ivjeti. Vi jako dobro znate �to je tamo. Ne mogu to ni pomisliti, a kamoli izgovoriti.\n\n\n\n\n\nPomozite mi da se izborim za njega, rekla je ocajna majka.\n\n\n\n\n\nHrvatska je zemlja u kojoj gradanin mo�e biti zatvoren samo zato �to je poku�avao sam sebi spasiti �ivot, ali i zemlja u kojoj pozivanje na famoznog Toma Forda mo�e itekako upaliti, popije li se kava s pravim ministrom.","tags":[],"harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721795&p=4s5&v=1&x=U56KSGzMpbyHd4ZtbHoQKw","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"680","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721795","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.novilist.hr/var/novilist/storage/images/_aliases/fb_friendly_img/vijesti/hrvatska/zasto-su-osudili-huanita-na-dvije-godine-zatvora-a-famoznog-toma-forda-uzimaju-za-ozbiljno/15371606-1-cro-HR/Zasto-su-osudili-Huanita-na-dvije-godine-zatvora-a-famoznog-Toma-Forda-uzimaju-za-ozbiljno.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"author":{"name":"Portal Novilist.hr","publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"36434","name":"Novi list","homeUrl":"http://www.novilist.hr","category":"National","editorialRank":"3","location":{"country":"Croatia","countryCode":"HR","region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"5.40","pageAuthority":"54.00","domainAuthority":"60.00","externalLinks":"138426","links":"463744"}},"feed":{"id":"169687959","name":"Novi list","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"65"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940767349","id":"38350721798","language":"English","languageCode":"en","title":"EUR: The ECB Effectively Closed The Door For Rates 'Lift-off' Under Draghi's Watch - SEB","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Forex Crunch: http://forexcrunch.com Delivered by Newstex)  The ECB left its policy measures unchanged and acknowledged the slowdown. However, Draghi remained optimistic about wages. What's next? Here is their view, courtesy of eFXdata:'As expected, today's ECB (interim) meeting delivered no monetary policy changes. All policy parameters including the wording of forward guidance remained unchanged. Contrary to our expectation, however, the ECB chose to downgrade its assessment of the balance of risks by stating these hade 'moved to the downside' (previously 'broadly balanced'). This opens the door, in our view, to a downward revision of ECB staff projections and, possibly even a change in the wording of forward guidance at the next meeting on 07 March. On the question of a new round of LTROs, the ECB kept all options open; we continue to expect the bank to offer new LTROs by mid-year,' SEB notes. 'With regard to the timing indications of 'lift-off', i.e. the first policy rate hike, Draghi repeated his 13 Dec statement that market pricing showed that markets had understood the ECBs reaction function.Overall, the outcome of today's meeting was somewhat more dovish than we had expected. The ECB has, in our view, effectively closed the door for ECB rates 'lift-off' under Mario Draghi's watch,' SEB adds.

FCPA Statistical Feast","content":"Jan 25, 2019( FCPA Professor: http://www.fcpaprofessor.com Delivered by Newstex)  If the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is an area of your practice or interest, this post may make you feel like a kid in a candy store. With much rhetoric floating around regarding the FCPA and withmany creative and haphazard counting methods employed by certain FCPA Inc. participants[1], it is instructive to take a look at actual statistics using accurate and consistently applied math. FCPA Professor has been the place to visit this month for in-depth 2018 FCPA enforcement statistics as well as comparisons to historical statistics. If you missed the daily posts, no worries. This post consolidates in one place the statistics recently published on FCPA Professor.This post[2] highlights the origins of 2018 corporate FCPA enforcement actions. Like prior years, 2018 corporate enforcement actions originated in a variety of ways from voluntary disclosures, to pro-active government investigations and industry sweeps, to foreign law enforcement investigations. This post[3] highlights how the gray cloud of FCPA scrutiny lasted too long in 2018. Specifically,4.25 years was the median length of time companies thatresolved FCPA enforcement actions in 2018 were under scrutiny. https://www.bdo.com/services/consulting/global-risk-investigations/overview This post[4] compares 2018 corporate FCPA enforcement (aggregate DOJ/SEC) to prior years and highlights that, measured in terms of the number of core corporate actions, 2018 was the third most active year for enforcement in FCPA history. This post[5] focuses specifically on DOJ FCPA enforcement in 2018 and contains a number of statistics including comparisons to historical norms. This post[6] highlights DOJ FCPA enforcement actions against individuals and how approximately 80% of corporate FCPA enforcement actions since 2006have not(at least yet) resulted in anyDOJ FCPA charges against company employees. This post[7] takes a closer look at DOJ FCPA enforcement actions against individuals and the strange public - private divide. In other words, even though most corporate FCPA enforcement are against issuers, most individual actions against individuals associated with non-issuers. This post[8] focuses specifically on SEC FCPA enforcement in 2018 and contains a number of statistics including comparisons to historical statistics. This post[9] highlights SEC FCPA enforcement actions against individuals and how just 1 of the 14 corporate SEC FCPA enforcement actions in 2018 (7%) has involved, at present, related FCPA charges or findings against company employees. This post[10] highlights the alleged 'foreign officials' from 2018 corporate enforcement actions. This post[11] highlights how much of the largeness of 2018 corporate enforcement was a result of enforcement actions against foreign companies from OECD Convention countries and poses the question: should the U.S. back off of such prosecutions? And finally, with many creative and haphazard counting methods infecting all sorts of FCPA enforcement statistics, this post[12] once again highlights why FCPA Inc. needs a common language. http://fcpaprofessor.com/institute FCPA Institute - Nashville (April 11-12, 2019) A unique two-day learning experience ideal for a diverse group of professionals seeking to elevate their FCPA knowledge and practical skills through active learning.

They generally do so whether or not any rent was unpaid or there were other disturbances from the tenants. Now, the legislator has put a stop to this practice for future cases.The change in the law was necessitated by a problematic development in assisted living: where landlords were fairly glad to rent apartments to social institutions for various reasons a few years ago, the market has become increasingly contracted recently. Most of the social institutions in the assisted living sector find it very hard to find suitable housing due to rapidly increasing rents.At the same time, landlords are increasingly terminating leases without failure from the tenants (such as rent arrears or disturbances). This practice is particularly observed after real estate sales to institutional investors which are looking for ways to increase their returns - this is where a replacement of low-rent tenants comes in handy.Until the end of 2018, the option of such terminations has been offered due to a gap in the law since there was no clear legal protection for social institutions when renting apartments. Protection against terminations only existed where expressly agreed on or where the court had interpreted the contract to include such a clause during an eviction trial. The latter were rulings on individual cases that depended on the opinion of the respective court. In this respect, the social institutions did not have any legal certainty.And what is worse: the loss of the apartment for the social institution also meant that the affected clients were automatically obligated to leave their apartment and their center of life without being granted any protection!This gap has now been closed by the legislator. Since January 1, 2019, new leases between landlords and social institutions are mostly subject to a statutory protection against termination (new Section 578(3) Civil Code). Therefore, the crowding out of assisted living without legitimate interests is at least barred for all future cases.Practical tip:With the new Section 578(3) Civil Code, statutory provisions on rent increase options and on handling cases of conversion into condominiums were also introduced for such contracts. Therefore, both social institutions and landlords are well advised to familiarize themselves with the contents of Section 578(3) Civil Code for their future contracts.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

sell, or hold: What the Mets' roster needs before spring training starts","content":"Brodie Van Wagenen has been one of the most active general managers in baseball throughout his first offseason, and there is still time for him to make more moves.\n\nJust like last offseason, there are still plenty of free agents available even with pitchers and catchers set to report to Port St. Lucie, Fla. in less than three weeks.\n\n\"We feel good about the primary players we have currently on our roster,\" Van Wagenen said Thursday. \"So the depth would be more of a focus for us going forward.\"\n\nHere's a look at where the Mets stand, and whether they can stand pat, have enough depth to trade or need to acquire another player or two. \n\nThe Mets landed their everyday catcher when they signed Wilson Ramos, and settled on their backup when they traded Kevin Plawecki and kept Travis d'Arnaud.\n\nTomas Nido serves as the third-string option.\n\nThat trio is a fine unit to head into the season with, but due to d'Arnaud's injury history, it would not hurt the Mets to see if there is a veteran catcher they could sign as insurance in case d'Arnaud or Ramos � who have both battled injuries � suffer an injury.\n\nVeterans Martin Maldonado, Matt Wieters and Devin Mesoraco are among the free agents remaining. , the Mets have an abundance of players they can use at third base and first base this upcoming season: Lowrie, Todd Frazier, Jeff McNeil, Dom Smith, JD Davis and prospect Peter Alonso. \n\nThe Mets can't carry all of those players on the 40-man roster at one time, and are going to have to be creative to find at-bats for the aforementioned players. Davis is one player the Mets believe has upside that can be tapped into with more regular at-bats.\n\nThe odd man out in this mix appears to be Dom Smith, but the issue is the Mets would be selling low on the former first-round pick. Smith is the Mets' best defensive first baseman, but the team is hopeful Alonso can be an everyday option.\n\nPerhaps the Mets can find another team with a former top prospect to swap.\n\nThe Mets' double-play duo in 2019 will feature Amed Rosario and Robinson Cano although Lowrie and McNeil should get time at second base as well.\n\nLowrie is currently the team's top reserve shortstop although glove-first reserve Luis Guillorme could be called up.\n\nThe Mets would be wise to see if they could find a shortstop to sign to a minor league deal as insurance for Rosario since Lowrie should not be an everyday shortstop. Guillorme also should not be the primary backup for a contending team.\n\nAdeiny Hechavarria, Alcides Escboar and Jose Iglesias are veteran shortstops that have yet to find a home. from two heel surgeries. The Mets are hoping he will contribute in 2019 and perhaps return around the All-Star break, even citing Cespedes as a reason to pass on star free agents. \n\nThe corner outfield spots are set with Michael Conforto and Brandon Nimmo, but the team's center field duo of Juan Lagares and Keon Broxton is underwhelming. Lagares struggles to stay healthy and Broxton was demoted several times last year.\n\nNimmo and Conforto can both play center field if needed which would allow the Mets to consider corner outfielders if they desired. despite the room for improvement in center field.\n\nAdam Jones and Carlos Gonzalez perhaps could be fits on low-cost deals and provide camp competition. The team doesn't have the proper depth to withstand an injury to Conforto or Nimmo, and there's no telling how much Cespedes will contribute.\n\nFinding the right outfielder could be challenging since the trade market does not have many center fielders that would be clear upgrade\n\nThe Mets have addressed their rotation depth this offseason by acquiring Walker Lockett from the Padres and Kyle Dowdy from the Indians. The Mets believe Lockett has potential, and Dowdy should have a shot at the Opening Day roster as a Rule 5 pick.\n\nThe slow-moving market affords the Mets the chance to perhaps find a bargain which would allow the team to bring in competition for Jason Vargas.\n\nVeterans such as Wade Miley, Gio Gonzalez, James Shields, Drew Pomeranz and Edwin Jackson all have yet to sign. There could come a point when they sign for little money, and the Mets could be in position to find a quality option. \n\nThe Mets like the bullpen they've assembled with Edwin Diaz and Jeurys Familia anchoring the unit, but more depth is always a good thing.\n\nLittle money has been invested into this unit thus far, and there are still some free agents that could bolster the unit.\n\nTony Sipp or Justin Wilson could provide competition to Luis Avilan for the lefty specialist role, and righties like Adam Warren, Greg Holland and Ryan Madson are still available. Like the starting market, there could be a cost-efficient deal to be made.

Meaning Of lsquo;Intent'","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  S Franses Ltd (Appellant) v The Cavendish Hotel (London) Ltd (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 62 On appeal from: [2017] EWHC 1670 (QB)Business tenants have the protection of security of tenure. When their business tenancy ends they are generally entitled to a protected renewal tenancy at an open market rent. However a landlord can oppose a renewal tenancy if it intends to substantially demolish or reconstruct the premises occupied by the tenant. The question which was leapfrogged from the High Court to the Supreme Court was whether it is open to the landlord to oppose the grant of a renewal tenancy (under section 30(1)(f) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954) if the works which the landlord says he intends to carry out would have no proper purpose other than to rid the landlord of the tenant and would not be undertaken at all if the tenant were to leave voluntarily.This case concerned the ground floor and basement of 80 Jermyn Street, St James's in central London. The tenant is S Franses, a textile dealership and consultancy, specialising in antique tapestries and textiles. It occupies the ground floor and basement as a retail art gallery, showroom and archive. The rest of the building is occupied and managed by the landlord as the Cavendish Hotel. In March 2015, S Franses served statutory notices requesting a new tenancy. In May 2015, Cavendish Hotel served a statutory counter- notice opposing the grant of a new tenancy on the grounds of substantial reconstruction. Cavendish Hotel's scheme of works included the lowering of part of the basement floor slab, in a way which the Court concluded would achieve nothing other than the creation of an impractical stepped floor in one of the retail units; the repositioning of smoke vents for no reason; and the demolition of an internal wall at ground floor level followed by its immediate replacement with a similar wall in the same place. It would be impossible to make any use of the retail units without planning permission for change of use, which Cavendish Hotel did not intend to seek. In addition, one of the two retail units that would be created would also be unusable having no entrance from the street. Nevertheless, Cavendish Hotel provided a written undertaking to the Court to carry out the works costing approximately 800,000 if the renewal tenancy was refused. Cavendish Hotel in evidence acknowledged that the sole purpose of the substantial building works was to obtain from the Court a refusal of the renewal tenancy and vacant possession from S Franses and that the works were \"designed purely for the purpose of satisfying\" the ground.The County Court and High Court had both held that the Cavendish Hotel had proven at the date of the trial (i) that it had a genuine intention to carry out works; and (ii) that it would practically be able to do so, it was entitled to possession of the property under section 30(1)(f) and the refusal of a renewal tenancy. The motive of Cavendish Hotel was (in accordance with previous decisions) irrelevant.However, in the rather extreme circumstances of this case the Supreme Court last month held that the landlord's intention to carry out the works cannot be conditional on whether the tenant chooses to assert his claim to a new tenancy and to persist in that claim. Rather, the test is whether the landlord would intend to do the same works if the tenant left voluntarily. A conditional intention is not the fixed and settled intention that the ground of opposition under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 requires. Therefore Cavendish Hotel is not entitled to oppose the renewal and obtain possession of S Franses' premises. S Franses is entitled to a renewal lease.Lord Sumption also commented on a case where the landlord intended to carry out works unconditionally but these works were not substantial or disruptive enough to obtain possession from the tenant and so the landlord then artificially expands the scheme of works. In that case the test is whether at the time of the trial, were the tenant hypothetically to leave voluntarily, the landlord would not carry out the additional works, then the tenant's claim to a renewal tenancy would fall to be resolved by reference only to the works which the landlord unconditionally intended.It may be wise for landlords and their surveyors to disclose the intended works only when they have actually decided on their final plans for the works, otherwise they are at risk that the tenant could attempt to assert that their earlier schemes of lesser works were the works they would have carried out unconditionally and any additional works are just artificial as they would not have been carried out had the tenant left voluntarily. It is likely that some landlords will now find their redevelopment plans being more extensively examined by their tenants who might wish to test their landlord's true intentions.The article first appeared in our Real Estate Bulletin - Janaury 2019[1].The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

enth�llt: 440-Pfund-Mann verlangte nach Toilettengang das Unfassbare","content":"Stewardessen sind hart im Nehmen und erleben bei ihrer t�glichen Arbeit viele abenteuerliche Situationen - aber auch traumatische. So auch diese Angestellte. Sie m�ssen sich als \"Saftschubsen\" bezeichnen lassen, werden unsittlich ber�hrt, unversch�mt angesprochen oder wie Leibeigene behandelt. Viele Stewardessen k�nnen von haarstr�ubenden Begebenheiten mit unm�glichen Passagieren berichten. Dieser neue Fall schl�gt dem Fass allerdings den Boden aus.\n\nTaiwanesische Flugbegleiterin berichtet �ber traumatischen Toilettenvorfall\n\nAuf einer Pressekonferenz der taiwanesischen Fluggesellschaft Eva Air berichtete eine aufgel�ste Flugbegleiterin nun, wie sie und zwei ihrer Kolleginnen von einem stark �bergewichtigen Passagier auf einem 14-st�ndigen Flug dazu gezwungen wurden, ihn beim Toilettengang zu unterst�tzen. Der wohl �ber 200 Kilo schwere Mann verlangte allerdings nicht nur, dass die Frauen ihn zur Toilette begleiten. Sie sollten ihn ausziehen und danach zu allem �berfluss auch noch s�ubern. Er k�nne dies aufgrund einer Hand-OP und wohl auch seines Umfangs angeblich nicht selbst. \"Ich vergesse diesen Moment niemals\", sagte die Frau laut CNN. \"Sein Kot war noch immer im Klo, ich hatte keinen Ausweg. Wenn ich daran denke, wird mir sofort wieder �bel. Ich f�hle mich traumatisiert.\"\n\nWeigern konnten sich die Flugbegleiterinnen nach eigenen Angaben nicht. Der Passagier habe damit gedroht, die verbleibenden elf Stunden Flug auf der Toilette zu verbringen.Nicht die erste eklige Aktion des dreisten Passagiers\n\nAls die widerliche Aktion durch einen Social-Media-Post einer der Betroffenen bekannt wurde, hatte Eva Air zun�chst noch versucht, den Passagier in Schutz zu nehmen. Dieser sei bereits zwanzig Mal mit der Airline geflogen - ohne Vorf�lle. Ein Mitglied der Gewerkschaft der Flugbegleiter hielt in der Pressekonferenz allerdings dagegen, dass der Mann schon einmal verlangt hatte, dass man ihn nach dem Toilettengang s�ubere. Als sich die Kabinenbesatzung weigerte, habe er kurzerhand auf seinen Sitz gekotet. Nun denke die Airline �ber einen Ausschluss des Passagiers nach.\n\nVideo: Vorurteils-Check Stewardess ante Zur FotostreckeZur�ck zur �bersicht: Reise","tags":[],"harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:48Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721850&p=4s5&v=1&x=i8Ia8dw7VvuNg_zO3zb75Q","outboundUrls":["https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/23/asia/taiwan-eva-air-incident-intl/index.html"],"wordCount":"299","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38338881753","media":{"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.rosenheim24.de/bilder/2019/01/24/11469816/166219387-stewardess-toilette-BHU8pyrapef.jpg"}],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["SUB"],"name":"PRESSEKONFERENZEN","score":"70"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"FLUGGESELLSCHAFTEN","score":"76"},{"domains":["GEO"],"name":"TAIWAN","score":"58"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.615297","entities":[{"type":"Company","value":"Eva Air","mentions":"1","score":"0.0","evidence":"1","confident":true},{"type":"Person","value":"Eva Air","mentions":"1","score":"1.23059","evidence":"3","confident":true}]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"193242","name":"Rosenheim24.de","homeUrl":"https://www.rosenheim24.de","category":"Local","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"5.10","pageAuthority":"51.00","domainAuthority":"57.00","externalLinks":"54933","links":"82982"}},"feed":{"id":"617266091","name":"Rosenheim24.de","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2662"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940769010","id":"38350721854","language":"Greek","languageCode":"el","title":"S???a????�e t?? ????da ?a? t? ?.?a?ed???a ??a t?? ep?????s? t??

Stay tuned and you�ll see what we have found out. \n \nThere are many pros and cons of living in a suburban area or a small city. Of course, there are those who prefer city hustle to a peaceful neighborhood, and then, there are no dilemmas. But, living in a small town near to the metropolis such as NYC has some pros that would take advantage over a life in a big city. General pros of living in NJ are: having more space � both in your living area and in the neighborhood, more parking spaces, less crowding, according to the opinions of people who have experienced living in both areas. On the other side, the cost of living in NY and NJ is more or less the same, both being quite expensive. \n \nKiselev Andrey Valerevich/Shutterstock.com \n \nToday, we will not discuss all the best places to live outside NYC, because that is a much wider topic, and the suggestions depend mostly on personal preferences, costs of living and many other parameters. But there are some recommendations for the nice suburbs just outside NYC, such as Ardsley, Upper Montclair or Jericho. They also include some of the best NJ suburbs close to NYC, like Highland Park, Haworth or Ridgewood. If traveling to work is your main worry, and you are wondering where to live in New Jersey to commute to Manhattan, take a look at our list of the 10 Best Commuter Towns in NJ to NYC . \n \nIn order to see which NJ towns with direct train to NYC and the best schools are optimal for our list, we took both criteria into account, but we ranked the towns according to school ratings as a category of greater importance. So, for the towns with direct lines to NYC, we searched City-data forum and NJFamily . The information on public school rankings for 2018 we found on Niche . And finally, for the opinions that have taken both criteria into account, we looked at Trulia and City-data again. \n \nSince schools are our primary goal now, concerning New Jersey, we found out that Jersey City is a town with the best schools in NJ, where McNair Academic High School is located, which was ranked the No.1 school in New Jersey in 2018. And among the best school districts close to NYC , there is a choice between Jericho Union Free School District, Rye City, New Canaan, Scarsdale Union Free School District, all located in the state of New York. Whereas, the best school districts in NJ included West Windsor-Plainsboro Region, Tenafly Public Schools, Bernards Township School District and Millburn Township School District. \n \nBut having in mind only NJ towns with direct trains to NYC and the best schools, we have made a bit different selection.

On January 23, 2019, the Thousand Movement, a collective of unions and grassroots activists, held demonstrations[2] in 30 locations across[3] Sri Lanka calling on plantation companies to increase the daily basic salary of tea estate workers to Sri Lankan Rs.1000 (US$5.50)[4] or double the current minimum daily wage. Protesters say that poverty is on the rise among the tea workers as wages stagnate in comparison to the growing cost of living. According to Chinthaka Rajapakshe[5], Moderator of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform (MONLAR): Recently researchers from the University of Peradeniya found that Rs 27,707 (US$ 152) is needed per month for one person in the estate sector to meet his or her basic needs. But on average these workers get paid less than Rs. 8000 (US$ 44) a month.Generations of #plantationworkers[6] have propped up our economy by toiling under deplorable conditions from 6am-6pm, come rain or shine.

The country's central highlands and low-elevation areas boast numerous tea estates which benefit from a climate that produces high-quality tea. Over the years, tea from Sri Lanka or 'Ceylon Tea' has grown in popularity � almost one-fifth of the teas sold around the world are from Sri Lanka. The industry employs (directly or indirectly)over 1 million people[32]. Many of the 500,000 tea estate workers[33] are Tamils descended from cheap laborersbrought to Sri Lanka from India[34] by the British colonial rulers in the 19th century, and more than half of the workers are women.[ Image removed: ][35] Sri Lankan tea plantation workers weighing plucked tea leaves which will determine their daily wage. Image by Flickr user NH53. CC BY 2.0Severely Low WagesTraditionally, workers have been paid severely low wages[36] compared to the national average. In many cases, they have to collect 16kg to 18kg worth of tea per day or their pay is halved. They are subjected to harsh living and working conditions[37],and some of them sustain painful injuries[38] with little medical support from the tea estates. Approximately a decade ago, they were protesting to increase the daily wage[39] to 500 rupees (US$4 in 2009) from 290 rupees (US$2.5 in 2009). But their demands were not met as the industry was hit by the global recession[40] and some tea estates were forced to lay off workers. In 2016, their daily wage was increased by a mere Rs.50 to Rs. 500. Over the years, the Sri Lankan Rupee has depreciated[41] while the cost of living has increased. Their daily wage corresponds to US$2.75 in today's currency, so, in essence, their wage has not increased in a decade. As a result, the poverty level among plantation workers has increased, although the overall poverty in Sri Lanka has declined in the past decades:(3/3) 'Political leaders, if you can survive on Rs 625/day, then we don't need Rs 1000/day' Protesters today challenged politicians to live on Rs. 625/day- the same wage proposed for #plantation[42] workers in the collective bargaining agreement. #ceylontea[43] #lka[44] #SriLanka[45] pic.twitter.com/y4zuOpYCc2[46]; � Lisa Fuller (@gigipurple) January 23, 2019[47]Malaiyaha Tamil tea plantation workers' struggle for an increase in their basic wage to Rs. 1000 continues. A citizen protest in solidarity will take place from 4.30 - 5.30pm at Liberty roundabout today (Jan 15). Cartoon by Namal Amarasinghe. #lka[48] #SriLanka[49] #Pongal[50] pic.twitter.com/muPWlCsTKX[51]; � Groundviews (@groundviews) January 15, 2019[52] The government has proposed[53] an all-inclusive wage hike with the increase to be made over a 3-year period. Under this plan, the basic increase would be up to Sri Lankan Rs. 625 in the first year with other allowances, adding up to Rs.1000 daily. Some of these allowances are based on a daily quota of leaves plucked - so many are likely to miss out. The proposed increase in basic daily pay in the second and third years would be to Rs.650 and Rs.675 respectively. However, the demand of the workers is that the daily basic pay should be increased to Rs. 1000. The tea estate workers have no choice other than to continue their fight[54] for a fair wage if they don't want to succumb to enslavement or absolute poverty.

Is Still Copyrighted, Even To Learn Where Trump Is","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Mondaq: http://www.mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  While attending his friend's wedding at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey in June 2017, Jonathan Otto took a photograph of a certain wedding crasher: the president himself.Otto texted the photo to his friend, Sean Burke, another guest at the wedding. By the next morning, the image had gone viral and ended up on TMZ, CNN, the Washington Post, the Daily Mail, and a Hearst Communications' publication, Esquire. Apparently, Burke had sent the photo to Linda Piatowski (a relative of the bride), she had posted it on Instagram, and the media outlets copied it from there.The day after the media outlets published the photo, Otto registered it with the Copyright Office and filed suit in federal court (the Southern District of New York) against the media outlets that had published it. Everyone settled except Hearst. In a recent decision, the court rejected Hearst's defenses across the board, finding instead that a media outlet cannot poach a photograph from social media, publish it without change, and avoid paying the photographer for the right to do so.Ruling on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, the court granted Otto's motion (which was directed to his claim of infringement and Hearst's affirmative defenses, including fair use) and denied Hearst's (which was directed to fair use and lack of willfulness). In particular, the court found that Otto owned a valid copyright in the photograph and that Hearst had infringed his copyright through its direct copying of the image without permission. Turning to Hearst's defenses, the court then rejected Hearst's argument that its publication of the photograph was transformative because it had been created for personal use but Hearst had used it for news. Instead, the court found that Hearst had published the image without adding ldquo;new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings,rdquo; and thus for the same purpose Otto had taken itmdash;to capture something Otto thought was a newsworthy event. As a result, the court concluded, even though the publication of the photograph was factual, the news story containing it was little more than a description of the location of the image and therefore not transformative. He also found that the image's having gone viral did not make Hearst's use fair, noting that Otto recognized, two days after the wedding, that he might be able to register and license the image.Next, the court found that when Otto sent the image to Burke, he neither waived his right to assert his copyright nor consented to the image being used by Burke and posted on social mediamdash;and then picked up by Hearst and other news outlets. The court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that sending the image to Burke without explicit restrictions constituted a license for Burke to use the image however he wished. The court further found that even if Otto had intended to allow Burke to disseminate the image, any such permission was not applicable to Hearst.Finally, the court held that because a reasonable jury could differ on whether Hearst's infringement was willfulmdash;allowing for statutory damages against Hearst of up to $150,000 per infringed workmdash;Hearst's motion for summary judgment that it did not act willfully had to be denied. Despite Hearst's lack of actual knowledge of Otto's ownership of the image, the court concluded that a reasonable jury could find that it had constructive knowledge, i.e., that it was ldquo;willfully blindrdquo; to whether it was committing copyright infringement. In reaching this conclusion, the court pointed to the fact that Hearst was in the publishing business, and thus had knowledge of copyright law and licensing procedures, as well as the fact that Hearst had been repeatedly sued for infringement in the recent past. Further, the court noted that while Hearst, in supporting its argument that it had not acted willfully, had pointed to the fact that the article credited Ms. Piatowski's Instagram account as the source of the photo, that did not ldquo;carry as much weight as [Hearst] might hope.rdquo; As the court said, even if Hearst believed that Ms. Piatowski owned the photograph, nothing in the record showed that Hearst had attempted to contact her to solicit either a license for the photograph or her approval to use it.The case continues towards trial, but with a number of the most important issues now decided in Otto's favor.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The key announcements included the further extension of the due date of filing of the GST annual return (GSTR-9) and reconciliation statement (GSTR-9C), rationalization of rates, higher registration thresholds and clarifications regarding refund related issues that are being faced by the taxpayers.Top TrendsExtension of GSTR-9 (Annual Return) and GSTR-9C (Reconciliation Statement) of the financial year 2017-18 to 30 June 2019.Simplified GST returns will be rolled out on a trial basis from 1 April 2019 and mandatorily from 1 July 2019.The GSTN to provide the facility to electronically upload the supporting documents in relation to a claim for refund in GST RFD-01A, thereby eliminating the need for physical submission at the jurisdictional offices.Taxpayers who have not furnished the GST returns for two consecutive tax periods would not be allowed to generate E-way bills.The time limit for availing Input Tax Credit (ITC) for invoices pertaining to the FY 2017-18 has been extended to the due date of filing GSTR-3B of March 2019.States have the option to implement a higher GST registration threshold limit of INR 4 million for a supplier of goods.Judicial Pronouncements It should be noted that an Advance Ruling is binding only on the applicant who had sought it and the concerned jurisdictional authority, i.e., an Advance Ruling is specific to an applicant and shall not be applicable to other taxpayers facing similar issues. However, the above-mentioned Advance Rulings provide clarity about the issues being faced and have persuasive value in matters before the tax authorities.Compliance Chart for Upcoming GST Due DatesOther Key AspectsRevenue collectionsThe government's gross GST collections in the month of December 2018 stood at INR 0.94 trillion. The government's monthly target of GST revenue collection of INR 1 trillion was not achieved and dropped for the second consecutive month. It would be interesting to see how the recent rationalization of GST rates impacts the revenue collections.Other key updates under the GST regimeThe GST council has approved to charge 1% cess on the intra-state supply of goods and services within Kerala for a period not exceeding two years.The amendments to the GST law passed by the Parliament in August 2018 would be notified with effect from 1 February 2019.It has been made mandatory to file all GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B for the financial year 2017-18 before filing the annual return.Composition dealers would be required to file one annual return and pay taxes quarterly along with a simple declaration from 1 April 2019.Security services provided by non-corporates are liable to GST under reverse charge mechanism from 1 January 2019.The supplier or his authorized representative would not be required to provide his physical signature or digital signature in case of issuance of the invoice and related documents in accordance with the provisions of Information Technology Act 2000.GST in the newsThe GST Council may soon decide to provide a mechanism to amend forms TRAN-1 and TRAN-2 to enable taxpayers to rectify any errors made in availing transitional credit.The mining industry has appealed to the government to introduce a single GST rate for the sector to replace the existing system of a multiplicity of taxes.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

According to Budi Rahardjo, INDO CISC CIO and head of the panel of judges, the winners are being chosen based on originality, coherence between the solutions and the categories that the participants have chosen, benefits, UI and UX experience, presentation skills, and use of API. The hackathon itself is part of a CSR programme by CBN and FiberStar, who had donated several Weather IP tools to the government agency, in order to support Bandung's smart city plan[2]. � Image Credit: HACKBDGWEATHER The post Meet the 3 winners of Bandung's HACKBDGWEATHER hackathon[3] appeared first on e27[4].

Were the Police During Covington Catholic Confrontation?","content":"Where Were the Police During Covington Catholic Confrontation? Laurence Jarvik The standoff seemed go on for at least 45 minutes, yet no officer appeared to \"de-escalate\" the conflict, as called for in police guidelines. No one interposed themselves between two hostile camps. No one asked anyone to \"move along\" or \"break it up.\" Instead, police permitted a tense confrontation between crowds which could have led to a bloody brawl, or worse. After seeing Tweets and YouTube videos about the Covington Catholic School kids confrontation with Nathan Phillips and the Black Hebrew Israelites on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the March for Life on January 19th, someone I know asked: \"Where were the police?\" A very good question. The standoff seemed go on for at least 45 minutes, yet no officer appeared to \"de-escalate\" the conflict, as called for in police guidelines. No one interposed themselves between two hostile camps. No one asked anyone to \"move along\" or \"break it up.\" Instead, police permitted a tense confrontation between crowds which could have led to a bloody brawl, or worse. It might have become another Charlottesville tragedy, had Nick Sandmann and the Covington Catholic students not kept their tempers under manful control. I'm not a lawyer, but it looked like the boys were being assaulted and harassed for \"standing while Catholic\" and wearing MAGA hats. If anyone is a victim in this case, it appears to be Nick Sandmann, who had a drum banged in his face while being insulted for his race and religion. So what does the police report show? When I asked DC's Metropolitan Police Department, Public Affairs Specialist Alaina Gertz said: \"Please contact US Park Police for this information.\" US Park Police Public Information Officer Sergeant Delgado told me he didn�t know if there were a police report, he couldn't look it up because of the government shutdown's furlough--and there might not be a report at all, if no one called the police. One wonders whether police no longer protect citizens from harassment or assault in public. Violent conflicts in Charlottesville, Berkeley, and Portland may be the tip of the iceberg of police failure to \"protect and serve\" the public.  Here in Washington, demonstrators violently disrupted the Inauguration in 2016, chased members of the Trump administration out of restaurants, and attacked the home of Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson. Senator Rand Paul was beaten up in Kentucky, after having been shot at with Congressman Steve Scalise and other Congressmen at a baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia. Instead of calling for calm, protection of civil rights, and respect for all citizens, the media and some Democrats have added fuel to the fire--posting horrific memes about school shootings, burning down Covington, punching students, or putting Catholic boys in woodchoppers. Racial taunts and epithets hurled at Catholic boys at the March for Life during the Martin Luther King Holiday weekend recall hateful insults spewed by Southern segregationists at African-American children in the 1960s. Fanning flames of racial and religious prejudice was wrong then--and is wrong now.  Martin Luther King's own words stand in rebuke to Nathan Phillips, the Black Hebrew Israelites, and their media collaborators: \"In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\" Amen.

The legislation defines minimum quality standards for reclaimed water to be used for agricultural irrigation. It also sets out obligations for production, distribution and storage operators, as well as risk management measures. Reclaimed water (i.e. urban wastewater that has undergone treatment in a reclamation facility) will be used to irrigate food crops, processed food crops and non-food crops. The Commission will have to assess whether reclaimed water can be used in other ways. MEPs say that in the meantime, member states may allow reclaimed water to be used in other ways, such as industrial water reuse and for amenity-related and environmental purposes, provided that human health, animals and the environment are thoroughly protected. 'We must move towards a circular economy, also in the use and re-use of water', said rapporteur Simona Bonaf (S...IT). 'We could potentially reuse 6.6 billion m3 of water by 2025, compared to the current 1.1 billion m3 per year. That would require an investment of less than �700 million and would enable us to reuse more than half of the current volume of water coming from EU wastewater treatment plants theoretically available for irrigation, avoiding more than 5% of direct extraction from bodies of wastes and groundwater', she added. Next stepsThe draft legislation was adopted with 53 votes to 1 and 4 abstentions. It will be put to a vote by the full House during the 11-14 February plenary session in Strasbourg. Background The water resources of the European Union are increasingly coming under pressure, leading to water scarcity and quality deterioration. In particular, climate change, unpredictable weather patterns and drought are putting a strain on the availability of freshwater needed for urban development and agriculture.Ensuring a wider reuse of treated wastewater could allow extraction from water bodies and groundwater to be limited. According to the European Commission, the frequency and intensity of droughts and their environmental and economic damage have drastically increased over the past thirty years. The droughts of the summer of 2017 may further illustrate the dimensions of economic loss; the Italian farming sector alone was predicting losses of �2 billion. Water over-abstraction, in particular for agricultural irrigation, but also for industrial use and urban development, is one of the main threats to the EU water environment.

to model the CDS model �. ehm, to model the CDS design �., sorry, I mean: \nthe tooling required to design the CDS model. \n \nYou can use the WebIDE or Visual Studio Code \n APPENDIX 1: create CDS model using WebIDE  \nThe advantage of using WebIDE : the tool is in the cloud, a cloud similar to the cloud where the Backend service can be found. \n \nGo to your trial account:  https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com \nIn the welcome screen, click on Neo Trial \nClick on �Services� in the left navigation pane \nSearch for �SAP Web IDE Full-Stack� (you can use the filter field in the upper right corner) \n \n\n \nClick on the Web IDE service tile. \nIf it is not yet enabled, (like in my screenshot) then just click on the �enable� button \nAfter a short while, the service gets enabled and you can click on �Go to Service� on the bottom of the screen. \n \n\n \nGuess what? The popular Web IDE is opened. \nYou may wish to bookmark the URL, it looks similar like this: \nhttps://webidecp-p1234567890trial.dispatcher.hanatrial.ondemand.com/ \n \nClick on the �Development� icon on the left pane, to go from the welcome screen to the development tool \n \n\n \nNow you need to first create a folder. \nYou can use right mouse click on the workspace node, then New -> Folder \n \n\n \nEnter a folder name of your choice \n \nThen create a file inside the folder. \nGive it a name of your choice with file extension .cds \n \ne.g. MyServiceDefinition.cds \n \nThe file is opened in the CDS editor. \nThe advantage of this editor is syntax highlighting and validation \n \nBelow example shows the validation marker and the highlighting: \n \n\n \nAfter you�re done with modelling, you can export the file to your local file system. \n \nBTW, WebIDE can be connected to Github, which allows you to share your design artifacts \n APPENDIX 2: create CDS model using Visual Studio Code  \nIf you�re a friend of coffee, kitten and local development, you might wish to use your Visual Studio Code for creating and editing CDS files. \n \nThis wish has come to reality by means of the CDS plugin for VS Code \n \nTo install Visual Studio Code, go to  the homepage at https://code.visualstudio.com/ \n \nTo install the CDS plugin, go to the SAP Development Tools site: https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#hanatools \nScroll down to the chapter �CDS Language Support for Visual Studio Code� \n \n\n \nClick on the link to download the vscode-cds-xxx-.vsix file to your local file system \n \nMost probably you�re familiar with installing extensions into VS Code \nIf you�re doing these steps for the first time, you may read on: \n \nOpen VS Code \nClick on View -> Extensions from the main menu (alternatively, click on the �Extensions� icon on the left pane) \n \n\n \nThe �Extensions� view is opened. It allows to browse public extensions. \nHowever, in order to add the downloaded extension file, click on the 3 dots, then �Install from VSIX� \n \n\n \nNavigate to your downloaded vscode-cds-xxx-.vsix file, then select and confirm \nThe extension is installed. \nAfter installation, VS Code needs to be reloaded \nAfterwards, you can see the enabled extension: \n \n\n \nNow it is your turn: create many many .cds files and enjoy the advanced features, e.g. the intelligent highlighting of occurrences (wow�even the $self reference is detected)","tags":[],"harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:45Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:45Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721425&p=4s5&v=1&x=NMxa8u1nKNZwhLhEstxJ4w","outboundUrls":["https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/","https://webidecp-p1234567890trial.dispatcher.hanatrial.ondemand.com/","https://code.visualstudio.com/","https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#hanatools"],"wordCount":"535","dataFormat":"text","duplicateGroupId":"38350721425","media":{"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[],"logo":[]},"publishingPlatform":{},"adultLanguage":"false","topics":[],"indexTerms":[{"domains":["IND"],"name":"CLOUD COMPUTING","score":"90"},{"domains":["IND"],"name":"INTERNET & WWW","score":"73"}],"companies":[],"locations":[],"semantics":{"events":[],"entities":[{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"SAP SE"},{"name":"rawValue","value":"SAP"},{"name":"instances","value":"4"},{"name":"relevance","value":"0.969"}],"provider":"3"},{"properties":[{"name":"type","value":"Company"},{"name":"value","value":"GitHub Inc."},{"name":"rawValue","value":"Github"},{"name":"instances","value":"1"},{"name":"relevance","value":"1.0"}],"provider":"3"}]},"sentiment":{"score":"0.48613065","entities":[{"type":"Product","value":"WebIDE","mentions":"1","score":"1.96","evidence":"3","confident":true},{"type":"Product","value":"Visual Studio Code APPENDIX 1","mentions":"1","score":"1.96","evidence":"3","confident":true}]},"author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"licenses":[{"name":"Publicly Available"}],"source":{"id":"65109","name":"SAP","homeUrl":"https://www.sap.com","category":"Corporate","editorialRank":"4","location":{"country":"Norway","countryCode":"NO","region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe"},"metrics":{"mozscape":{"mozRank":"7.00","pageAuthority":"70.00","domainAuthority":"90.00","externalLinks":"2751817","links":"3191358"}},"feed":{"id":"459652508","name":"SAP","mediaType":"News","tags":[],"language":"Unassigned","dataFormat":"text","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"inWhiteList":"true","autoTopics":[],"editorialTopics":["Professional","Energy"],"genre":"General"}}},{"sequenceId":"915940771083","id":"38350721426","language":"German","languageCode":"de","title":"Panasonic Werkzeug Systainer Transportbox Toolbox T-Loc 2DD","content":"Original Panasonic \nPower Tools-Werkzeug Zubeh�r-Nachbezug-Ersatzteil, Systainer-Toolbox \nT-Loc 2, Stappelbare Transportbox mit Inlay f�r Panasonic Powertools \nEY79A2 / EY74A2 / EY75A2 / EY75A7 / EY7552 / EY7960 / EY7460 / EY7950 / \nEY7450 / EY78A1. \n \nAnwendungen: Stappelbare Transportbox mit Inlay f�r 1 Ger�t \n(Bohrschrauber, Schlagbohrschrauber, Schlagschrauber etc.), Akku und \nLadeger�t. \n \nZubeh�r von Panasonic Powertools EY79A2 / EY74A2 / EY75A2 / EY75A7 / EY7552 / EY7960 / EY7460 / EY7950 / EY7450 / EY78A1. \n\nGr��e: H�he 160mm x Breite 400mm x Tiefe 300mm \n \nLieferung: \n \n1 x Panasonic Werkzeug Systainer T-Loc 2, \n \nBranchen: Montage im Zimmereihandwerk, Tischlerei, Trockenbau, Sanit�rinstallation, Zimmerei, Wintergartenbau, Verfugungen ,\n Tischler, Stahl- und Portalbau, Sanit�r, Montage, L�ftungsbau, St�dte, \nGemeinden, Kommunen, Kommunalbetriebe, Bauh�fe, KFZ-Werkst�tten, \nKFZ-Industrie, Innenausbau, Fuger ,\n Industrie, Holzbau, Gas-Wasser-Heizung, Fliesen-Platten-Mosaikleger, \nFertighausbau, Fensterbau, Fenster und T�ren, Schreiner, Fassadenbau, \nElektro-Installateure, Baumeister, Bauherren, Hobby-und Heimwerker. \n \nKomplettes Sortiment an Original Panasonic Power Tools lieferbar.

Open the door!' in dramatic pre-dawn raid following indictment in Mueller's Russia probe on seven counts related to WikiLeaks hack of Democrats' emails during 2016 election\n* Roger Stone, a former longtime confidant of President Donald Trump, arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n* Facing seven charges including making false statements and witness tampering\n* He is due to make his first court appearance later on Friday, as Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is also set to appear in court in Virginia * Stone has long been thought central to the investigation\n* He told DailyMail.com on January 4 that he didn't expect to be indicted: 'They've tried hard, but I didn't do anything illegal. That's why I'm not worried'\n* White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders insisted the indictment 'has nothing to do with the president and certainly nothing to do with the White House' Roger Stone, a former longtime confidant of President Donald Trump, was arrested in Florida on Friday morning following a federal indictment resulting from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's sprawling probe into Russian election meddling.\nFBI agents armed with rifles took the self-described political dirty trickster into custody in a dramatic pre-dawn raid with their weapons drawn and a lead agent shouting 'FBI! Open the door! We have a warrant!'\nWith tactical flashlights shining in his face, Stone confirmed his identity to the agents and was led away. Stone is charged with seven federal counts including five of making false statements, one of witness tampering and one of obstruction of official proceedings.\nRead more ....\nWNU Editor: For the past year many were predicting this arrest, including from Roger Stone himself. The indictment can be read from here, and after a quick read he is being hit with a process crime (lying and obstruction). The evidence that is being presented for the obstruction charge and lying to Congress looks strong to me. What I do not understand is why did he lie in the first place. The details that he was asked about were not criminal in nature. One of the persons that he threatened told him he was an idiot for lying (and that person is right). I guess we will find out more when he goes to trial, and (I predict) when he pleads out. As for Russian collusion .... there is nothing in this indictment pertaining to that. There is a reference that a campaign official wanted to know when Wikileaks would release their next batch of Democrat emails, but so what, everyone under the sun wanted to know at that time if Wikileaks was going to release more emails. As to who is that official? According to reports it is Steve Bannon, who has already talked to the Mueller Counsel and the Senate Intelligence Committee on this exchange .... Steve Bannon is the 'high-ranking' Trump official in Roger Stone indictment who asked about future WikiLeaks releases in October 2016 (CNBC).\nMore News On The Arrest Of Roger Stone Trump associate

Before you jump in , there are a couple of things to know about the demo.\n advertisement \rDemo Access\nFirst things first, if you want to play the VIP demo this weekend you�ll need either Origin (or EA) Access or to have pre-ordered the game. That or you got a friend pass from someone you know who has either of those. If you can�t get in to play this weekend, don�t sweat it, because the demo will be freely available to all next Friday, Feb 1. The VIP demo runs from today beginning at 9AM PT through Sunday, Jan 27.\nContent\nThe Anthem VIP demo will throw you somewhere into the middle of the critical path at level 10. You�ll be able to play through three missions, explore some of the game world through free roam gameplay, and even complete one of the game�s three Strongholds. You�ll also be capped at level 15 during this demo. Progress from the VIP demo will not carry over into the full game, but it will carry over into next week�s free demo.\nChoose Your Javelin\nAll four javelins will be available to play during the demo, but you�ll only be able to unlock one additional suit, so choose wisely. Everyone will start off with the Ranger and then gain access to a second suit pick once they reach level 12.  Here�s a TL;DR breakdown of the four javelins:\tRanger - Versatile jack-of-all-trades javelin. This is your Iron Man/War Machine fantasy.\tColossus - A massive javelin capable of tanking damage for his allies, firing off mortars, bashing in skulls with his shield, and setting the world on fire. Oh, and he gets access to heavy weapons, too.\tStorm - This is your glass cannon �mage� of Anthem. If you want to lord over the battlefield  slinging fireballs, calling down lightning strikes, or freezing your enemies, this is the javelin for you.\tInterceptor � The ninja. The Interceptor is nimble and is great in melee if that�s what you�re looking for. The suit is for players who always want to be on the move or who want to really get into enemies� faces.\nWhat�s Different?\nThe build you�ll be playing is different in some key ways from what you�ll find at launch. Besides being six weeks old, it�s also tuned to be a bit easier. Drops may be more frequent and/or better in quality. Cosmetics will also all be a flat 25 Coin (you�ll be given some Coin to play around with them). Basically, expect more bugs than you�ll find in the final game and expect for things to be a bit easier and more generous so that you can get the most out of your limited playtime.\nFeedback\nWhile this is a demo, BioWare is looking for some specific feedback on the game�s audio. If you�re interested in helping out, you can find more info here.\nRewards!\tPlay the Anthem VIP demo, get this vinyl in the full game. pic.twitter.com/wuGrRYovu1\t� Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) January 24, 2019\nBioWare recently announced some exclusive vinyls that will be made available in the full game to all players who take part in the VIP demo. They�re pretty cool looking, so definitely play if you can!\rMichael Bitton /\rMichael began his career at the WarCry Network in 2005 as the site manager for several different WarCry fansite portals.

court orders release of hunger striking Kurdish MP","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Turkish court on Friday ordered the supervised release of a detained lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) who is seriously ill after her 11-week hunger strike.Leyla Guven, 55, launched a hunger strike on November 8 in protest at the prison conditions Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan faces.Her deteriorating health has sparked real concern and seen rallies to support her cause.The court in the Kurdish majority southeastern city of Diyarbakir ordered her release under judicial supervision, including an overseas travel ban.Given the time already served in jail, the court ordered her release and adjourned. The next hearing is scheduled for May 29.Guven, whose party syas she has a \"life-threatening\" medical condition, did not attend the hearing, according to an AFP journalist in the court.The HDP supporters gathered outside the Diyarbakir prison and used buses and barricades to try to stop photographers from taking pictures of the ailing MP.\"The authorities should not have waited for her to reach death's door,\" Mehmet Cekikoglu, one of the supporters, told AFP. Ramazan Yakar, another party faithful, said Guven's release did not solve their problems, noting, \"there are still many others held behind the bars\". - 'Our resistance'-Guven was arrested in January 2018 for her criticism of Turkey's military operation against a Syrian Kurdish militia that Ankara considers an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The MP started the hunger strike in prison and was supported by more than 150 prisoners across Turkey in a show of solidarity. Guven's fast was aimed at pressuring the government into allowing lawyers and family members to visit PKK leader Ocalan, who has been serving a life sentence in an island prison near Istanbul since his 1999 capture.Ocalan met his brother Mehmet for the first time in more than two years on January 12, but details of the meeting have not been made public.In 2012, hundreds of Kurdish prisoners ended a 68-day hunger strike after Ocalan urged them to do so.Several representatives of left-wing political parties in Europe also followed Friday's hearing. Hakan Tas, Berlin Senator of Germany's Left Party \"Die Linke\" with Turkish roots, voiced support for Guven. \"The isolation of Mr Ocalan must immediately be lifted, so Leyla Guven's stance and resistance is also ours,\" he said. \"Today we are here in Diyarbakir to support her voice.\"Guven's HDP party remains under the scrutiny of Turkish authorities, which accuse it of links to the PKK. Several of its MPs are behind bars, including former party leader Selahattin Demirtas.The HDP said on Twitter the court ordered the release of Guven \"who started an indefinite hunger strike ... to protest the isolation of Abdullah Ocalan.\"It added: \"Our struggle for democracy, peace and freedom will continue.\"","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:45Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721435&p=4s5&v=1&x=2xqsZu_j_jclGtoCQqf5DQ","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"488","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

held in Thailand a 'test' for FIFA: ex-Aussie captain","content":"Jan 25, 2019( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Former Australia football captain Craig Foster said on Friday a Bahraini refugee player held in Thailand is a 'test' for FIFA, as rights groups try to duplicate the asylum success story of a Saudi woman who avoided deportation from the country.Foster is in Bangkok helping with the fight to free Hakeem Alaraibi, who was granted refugee status in Australia after fleeing an Arab Spring crackdown but was detained trying to holiday in Thailand in late November.His case was brought into the spotlight afterwards when a young Saudi woman named Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun avoided the same fate by barricading herself in a hotel room and tweeting pleas for help earlier this month, securing asylum in Canada in one week.Alaraibi, who played for Bahrain's national side, is accusing of taking part in riots that damaged a police station but he says he was playing in a match at the time.Rights groups say he faces a 10-year prison sentence if he is sent back. He believes he is being targeted for vocally criticising and opposing the FIFA presidential candidacy of senior vice-president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.FIFA's secretary general Fatma Samoura wrote an open letter to Thailand's prime minister and junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha on Wednesday asking for Alaraibi to be allowed to go home.But Foster told reporters in Bangkok that it is \"not enough\" and that FIFA could consider sports sanctions against football federations in Thailand and Bahrain.\"This is actually a seminal case to test the efficacy of the new human rights policy that FIFA has implemented,\" Foster said at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Bangkok.He visited Alaraibi in Bangkok Remand prison this week and said the footballer was in a \"very low state psychologically\". A 60-day detention period ends on February 8 but Bahrain has yet to file a formal extradition request with the court, his lawyer said this week.Human Rights Watch said Alaraibi was met by Thai police after getting off the plane and that they had a copy of his passport when he was 16 years old.Foster, activists and Alaraibi's football team in Melbourne, where he plays for the semi-professional Pascoe Vale, have all taken to social media to raise awareness, hoping that the same pressure built by al-Qunun could help.They are using the #SaveHakeem hashtag after the #SaveRahaf campaign. But Thailand's immigration chief has said the two cases are different and that there was an arrest warrant for Alaraibi.","tags":[],"publishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","harvestDate":"2019-01-25T15:00:45Z","estimatedPublishedDate":"2019-01-25T12:00:00Z","url":"https://ct.moreover.com/?a=38350721436&p=4s5&v=1&x=kap42NMh7nU4DYu81A8o2w","outboundUrls":[],"wordCount":"424","dataFormat":"text","copyright":"Copyright

aides distance him from Stone indictment","content":"President Donald Trump   (Photo: John Moore) \n\nWASHINGTON � The White House worked Friday to distance itself from Friday's indictment of President Donald Trump's former political consultant, Roger Stone. \n\n\"This this has nothing to do with the president, nothing to do with the White House,\" Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. \n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani said the case against Stone as developed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller involves mostly false statements, not a conspiracy with Russia that implicates the president. \n\nFalse statements are \"not right, you shouldn�t do that,\" Giuliani told The Washington Post. \"But there is no evidence of anything else but false statements. The president is safe here.\" \n\nRead or Share this story:
